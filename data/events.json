Northeastern regional coordinator Mahmoud Saleh told the Star the car the officers were travelling in was destroyed.  Governor Ali Roba condemned the attack saying locals shared information about a possible attack but were not taken seriously.  \"It is sad that the information had long been shared by locals,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.  Al Shabaab militants have carried out several attacks, two of which were on Makkah bus, which plies the Nairobi-Mandera route.  In December 2015, gunmen attacked a bus between Kotulo and Dabasiti in Mandera at 7am. The bus had stopped over at Kutulo following a ban on night travel in the region.  In 2014, a bus was attacked near Mandera by terrorists who killed 28 non-Muslims travelling to Nairobi for the Christmas holidays.  At least 45 al Shabaab militiamen were spotted crossing into the country on May 29.  A leaked intelligence report stated that the militants entered Kenya through the border village of Sugrow at around 2pm.

Presenting the Secretary-General\u2019s report on major developments in Mali since the end of March, he said that although the peace agreement was a package, for some time now, the process had been reduced to discussions about the establishment of an interim administration, which had been slow to occur. He added, however, that he was pleased with the compromise reached earlier this week, on the side lines of the ninth session of the Agreement Monitoring Committee. MINUSMA remained fully engaged and was ready to use its good offices to help support immediate implementation of the interim authorities. \u201cHowever, it is obviously clear that it is incumbent upon the parties [to] honour their commitments. It is for them to make the Peace Agreement and reconciliation a reality,\u201d the envoy emphasized. Mr. Annadif went on to say that since the 15-member Council\u2019s visit to Mali in early March, the situation on the ground had been troubling, with security having deteriorated in the past weeks. \u201cSince its deployment in 2013, MINUSMA has faced the deadliest threats of any United Nations mission ever deployed,\u201d he said, recalling that 19 peacekeepers had died following terrorist attacks between February and May 2016, 12 of them in May. The Mission had lost a total of 26, plus a United Nations contractor, when counting deaths due to accidents and disease. The numbers were even more distressing when one added losses resulting from the Barkhane operation and those among Mali\u2019s security, defence and civil forces. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cWe cannot continue to accept the unacceptable.\u201d Most of the deaths could have been avoided if the peacekeeping contingents involved had been better equipped, particularly with armoured vehicles. The 29 May attack on a MINUSMA convoy illustrated the terrorist threat in central and southern Mali, the envoy said, warning that the trend could spread and should not be forgotten.  Despite scepticism, however, there are signs of hope that the situation had improved since 2012, Mr. Annadif stated. Since the signing of the peace accord, all signatories to the ceasefire had demonstrated unwavering compliance and made dialogue a priority. Moreover, efforts are under way to establish a sound juridical and institutional framework, he said, describing the 18 May draft agreement to create a council on security-sector reform, under the Prime Minister\u2019s office, and the adoption of a decree establishing a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration commission as significant steps forward. He also told the Council that eight cantonment sites had been set up to allow the disarmament process to begin, noting that the integration of former combatants and the management of violent extremism were also positive steps. Mr. Annadif stressed the importance of reinforcing trust and confidence among the signatory parties, pointing out that the lack of effective control on the ground by other parties in the north had led to a spike in terrorism, organized crime, banditry and intercommunal tensions. The slower the peace accord\u2019s implementation, the more likely the peace process would capsize, he said, underlining that MINUSMA\u2019s future mandate should take those challenges into account. In light of the deadly attacks, the recommendations of the strategic review called for strengthening MINUSMA\u2019s personnel and air capacity in order to save lives, he said, adding that authorizing proactive operations would ensure that the Mission could fulfil its responsibilities and protect its staff. It could not do so alone, however. \u201cOnly a surge on the part of Mali\u2019s defence forces can tackle such challenges,\u201d continued Mr. Annadif, stressing that it must be part of a regional strategy in which various actors, such as the Group of 5 for the Sahel (G5 Sahel), the Nouakchott process, the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) and others would play a leading role. The situation in Mali impacted the whole of West Africa, he said, adding that recent attacks in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso demonstrated the fluidity of terrorist groups and the interdependence of States in the struggle against terrorism. \u201cI remain an optimist, a moderate one though,\u201d he said, while emphasizing that the status quo played into the hands of the enemies of peace. \u201cThe worst is behind us, but we must not forget that time is against us.\u201d Calling on all Malians to increasingly take ownership of the peace agreement, Mr. Annadif noted that people who had protested the accord in Kidal a year ago were today celebrating in Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu, and calling for its implementation.", "events": [], "date_published": "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 16:43:55 EST"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65APDqur0XqbxsOb", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Gartner "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Healthcare "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Gartner, Inc.

In a pastoral appeal to law enforcers issued yesterday, CBCP president and Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas said the CBCP is disturbed by the increasing number of reports that suspected drug peddlers and users were shot supposedly because they resisted arrest.  The CBCP also issued guidelines to law enforcers to prevent abuse.  Foremost among the guidelines is that law enforcers can \u201cshoot to kill\u201d solely for legitimate self-defense or defense of others.  Villegas noted that law and jurisprudence have sufficiently spelled out the elements of self-defense and for purposes of Catholic morality, \u201cit is necessary to emphasize that you, as law enforcers, can \u2018shoot to kill\u2019 only when there is unjust provocation; second, when there is a real, not only conjectural, threat to your life or to the lives and safety of others; and third, when there is due proportion between the threat posed and your own use of a firearm aimed at the threatening subject.\u201d  The CBCP guidelines also said that \u201cto kill a suspect outright, no matter how much surveillance work may have antecedently been done on the suspect, is not morally justified.\u201d  Villegas explained that\u00a0suspicion is never the moral equivalent of certainty, and punishment may be inflicted only on the ground of certainty.  When the arrest of a suspect is attempted and the suspect endeavors to escape, every attempt by non-lethal means should be made to stop the suspect from fleeing. If shot at, every attempt should be made to spare the fleeing suspect from death, unless the escape of the victim clearly and immediately puts others in harm\u2019s way.  The CBCP also said that it is never morally permissible to receive reward money to kill another.  \u201cWhen bounty-hunting takes the form of seeking out suspects of crime, killing them, then presenting proof of the death of the object of the hunt to the offeror of the reward, one is hardly any different from a mercenary, a gun-for-hire, no matter that the object of one\u2019s manhunt should be a suspected offender,\u201d Villegas said.  The CBCP pointed out thatit is also the moral duty of every Catholic and Christian to report all forms of vigilantism of which they have personal knowledge.  \u201cFor greater reason, it is a duty to keep away from any participation and any form of cooperation with vigilantes and vigilante movements,\u201d Villegas said.  \u201cThe impunity with which offenders of the law carry on with their criminal activity also points out flaws in our criminal justice system but remembering that the community is as much a pillar of this system as are all other components, members of the community \u2013 Christians especially \u2013 should not be too quick to point accusing fingers at law-enforcers, prosecutors and judges.  \u201cWe must all ask ourselves whether or not by our silence, our indifference or worse, our acts, we may have contributed to the proliferation of crime and the increase in criminal activity,\u201d he added.  Villegas further noted that bishops understand the difficulties that law enforcers face. \u201cBut not only civil society but also the Church counts on them for the flourishing of a society where all enjoy the blessings of a regime under laws that are just and institutions that are fair.\u201d  The CBCP called on the prosecutors and judges to remain firm in their consecration to justice.  \u201cThere can be no greater insult to the Creator than to use the gifts of intelligence, discernment and one\u2019s success at legal studies for ends contrary to building of the body of Christ and contributes the building of the Kingdom of God.\u201d  Villegas also appealed to law enforcers not to set God aside.  \u201cGod never gave up on us. We have no right giving up on ourselves or on our brothers and sisters,\u201d he said.  \u201cLet no one ever raise his hand against his brother or sister, for the blood that is shed \u2013 even if it be the blood of one we suspect of crime \u2013 cries to heaven for justice,\u201d he added.  The CBCP also called on Duterte and his allies in Congress to rethink their plan to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 12.

Photo: UNHCR/Rocco Nuri  15 June 2016 \u0096 While thousands of vulnerable people in South Sudan have been reached with assistance and protection in recent months, violent incidents against aid workers increased during the month of May, the United Nations humanitarian wing reported today.  According to a humanitarian update for South Sudan, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) found that 78 humanitarian access incidents were reported by partners in May, 73 per cent of which involved violence against aid personnel or their properties. The figure was higher than in April, when 48 incidents were reported, and also higher than the monthly average of 63 incidents reported from January to March.  \u201cRoad and river travel for humanitarians continues to be hazardous,\u201d OCHA said in the update.  The violent incidents \u2013 including shooting, ambushes, assaults, harassment and robberies \u2013 increased during May, and included the killing of three humanitarian workers, bringing the reported number of aid workers killed in South Sudan to 55 since the conflict began in December 2013.  Since January, there have been 29 incidents of robberies of vehicles while traveling to assess, deliver and pre-position vital supplies, 13 of them in the month of May. In Upper Nile, humanitarian partners were shot at while attempting to cross the River Nile to deliver humanitarian assistance between Malakal and Wau Shilluk on 26 and 30 May, OCHA said.  In the update, OCHA also reported that nearly 4,500 internally displaced people departed the Bentiu Protection of Civilians site in May, bringing the population in the site to about 95,000 at the end of the month.  Most of those departing \u2013 mainly adult men and women \u2013 reported that they planned on engaging in farming activities in Rubkona, Guit and Koch counties.  In addition, OCHA said that thousands of people have received humanitarian assistance in Guit, Koch, Mayom and Rubkona counties in recent months, as partners based in Bentiu took advantage of the dry season to extend aid to parts of Unity previously inaccessible by road.  About 103,400 people have been reached with food rations distributed outside the Bentiu Protection of Civilians site \u2013 including in Bentiu Town, Ding Ding, Kuach, Nhialdiu, Nimni, Bil, Kadet and Jazeera \u2013 since February, while seeds and fishing kits have been provided to about 7,400 households in Guit County and 10,000 in Koch County, OCHA said.  Nutrition surveys have been conducted in Guit and Rubkona in May, and support for acutely malnourished children and pregnant and lactating mothers is ongoing.  OCHA also highlighted that more than one year following the start of the offensive in south and central Unity in April 2015, which displaced hundreds of thousands of people, more than 310,000 people \u2013 including displaced, returnees and vulnerable host community members \u2013 are receiving humanitarian assistance and protection in southern Unity.  However, humanitarian partners have reported that their activities are increasingly impeded by under-funding. Ganyiel hospital, the only functioning referral theatre in southern Unity, has shortages of regular primary health-care commodities due to logistical constraints and road insecurities. In mid-April, health cluster partners from Bentiu had to send surgical and anaesthetic kits to the hospital, OCHA said.  In addition, OCHA reported that since August 2015, ongoing insecurity and four major outbreaks of fighting have affected Yambio and Gangura. As a result, civilians were displaced multiple times, including to the surrounding jungle areas and other payams.  Moreover, health partners are investigating an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever syndrome that has affected Aweil North and West counties since December 2015. The latest case was detected on 3 June, although no new deaths have been reported since 28 February, OCHA said.  As the rainy season begins, humanitarian partners are also working closely with relevant authorities to avert an outbreak of cholera.", "events": [], "date_published": "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 11:06:00 EST"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65JpDqur0XqbxsOy", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "United Nations "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Head of "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the UN Independent Investigation on Burundi "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNIIB"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "State"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the National Human Rights Commission "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Heyns"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNIIB "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the UN Human Rights Council "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Council in "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "April 25, 2015"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the beginning of the year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "December 2015 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "September 2016"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Tanzania"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Tanzania "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Burundi"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Arusha "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Brussels "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Burundi"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Burundi "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Christof Heyns"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nkurunziza "}], "url": "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54261", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Burundi: On second visit to country, UN human rights experts call for concrete steps to end crisis", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:18.588Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Burundians "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "five to 10 "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Burundian "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "third "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "hundreds "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "more than 240,000 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "thousands "}], "article": "AVWicgwWAi2xnyAOXn5_", "content": "More than a quarter of a million Burundians have fled to neighbouring countries since April 25, 2015, most of them to Tanzania.

Photo: UNHCR/Benjamin Loyseau  17 June 2016 \u0096 Concluding their second visit to Burundi, a team of United Nations independent human rights experts welcomed certain improvements in the country, but warned that the recent \u201ccalm should not be confused with long term stability,\u201d and also called on all parties in the country to stop the use of violence as a political tool.  The team reported a significant drop in the number of executions since the beginning of the year as a positive step, but also stated that the shrinking space for civil society actors remains a cause for concern.  Christof Heyns, one of the three independent experts and the Head of the UN Independent Investigation on Burundi (UNIIB) said that for the country to move away from conflict, an inclusive political dialogue addressing the roots of the political crisis is needed. He also called for the broadening of the recent talks in Arusha and Brussels to ensure that all actors of the crisis are included.  The team also expressed concern that many political prisoners remain in jail and that a new pattern of mass arrests has emerged, mostly affecting ordinary people, including children. \u201cIn various parts of the country, school children have been arrested or suspended from school because their books had scribbles on pictures of the Head of State. Some of them face the prospect of spending five to 10 years in jail. We will continue to closely follow these cases, including the actions taken by the National Human Rights Commission on them,\u201d said Heyns.  The team said that it looked forward to working further with the Burundian authorities and society to strengthen human rights protection in the country.  The UNIIB was established by the UN Human Rights Council in December 2015 to investigate human rights violations and abuses in Burundi, make recommendations on the improvement of the human rights situation, and engage in a dialogue with the authorities and other relevant actors in the ongoing crisis. It is scheduled to submit its final report to the Council in September 2016.  Burundi was thrown into crisis more than a year ago when President Nkurunziza decided to run for a controversial third term that he went on to win. To date, it has been reported that hundreds of people have been killed, more than 240,000 have fled the nation, and thousands more have been arrested and possibly subjected to human rights violations.", "events": [], "date_published": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 15:08:47 EST"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65LDDqur0XqbxsO0", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Apple Inc.

Under earlier rules for single brand retail, companies opening wholly-owned stores in India were required to comply with the local sourcing norms of 30% within five years of their first store opening. Photo: Mint  Mumbai: The government has made it easier for single brand retailers to setup operations in the country with an extended window of eight years before the application of the local sourcing norms come into play. However, for companies like Apple Inc. which were hopeful of getting a complete relaxation of sourcing norms on the grounds that they are a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d and \u201ccutting-edge technology\u201d company, it is a change in the opposite direction.  Under earlier rules for single brand retail, companies opening wholly-owned stores in India were required to comply with the local sourcing norms of 30% within five years of their first store opening. On Monday, this rule has been further tightened for entities undertaking single brand retail trading and seeking exemption from local sourcing norms will get a waiver only for three years along with a relaxed sourcing regime for five more years.  \u201cThe government appears to have tightened the sourcing norms for single brand trading in products having \u201cstate of the art\u201d and \u201ccutting edge\u201d technology. While the language is not too clear, it appears that the entities engaged in trading of such products would now need to comply with the sourcing norms over a period of 8 years (3 plus 5) as against an earlier norm where the government had the option to completely waiving the sourcing norms for such entities. If this is indeed the case, this move would adversely impact the fate of several companies especially in the technology space, that were hoping for a complete waiver on the grounds that the products proposed to be sold involved state of the art technology,\u201d said Kalpesh Maroo, partner, BMR & Associates LLP.  Yet, on the whole, the perception is that government has made it easier for retailers setting up under 100% single brand policy. \u201cThe assumption is that the earlier window of five years from the date of opening the first store is now being extended to eight years for all retailers coming in under single brand to comply with local sourcing,\u201d said Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte Haskins and Sells.  The government also notified the 100% FDI under approval route for trading, including through e-commerce for food products manufactured or produced in India which it had proposed during the Budget. As such, companies manufacturing food products in India will be allowed to set up retail stores and even have e-commerce operations in respect to the items manufactured in India. This could lead to companies like Wal-Mart Inc which have cash and carry wholesale operations and are ruled by the multi-brand retail policy to consider food retail in India. \u201cFDI in food retail is a very progressive step,\u201d Krish Iyer, president and chief executive, Walmart India had told PTI in April. He had said the company will study policy guidelines and take decisions appropriately.  To be sure, the current FDI policy in retail allows multi-brand retailers to invest only 51% while opening retail stores in the country. However, 100% FDI is allowed in wholesale cash and carry retail. So far, the multi-brand retail policy has failed to generate enthusiasm among overseas retailers, with just British supermarket chain Tesco Plc. entering the country in a 50:50 joint venture with Trent Hypermarket Ltd, part of Tata Group. In fact, French retailers Auchan Group and Carrefour S.A. abandoned their multi-brand plans in 2013 due to the tough regulatory environment.  Meanwhile, the relaxation of the single brand retail policy in September 2012 has seen furniture retailer Ikea, fashion retailer Hennes and Mauritz AB (H&M), sportswear retailer Adidas AG and Swiss watch retailer Swatch SA to come to India through this route. While Ikea\u2019s first store is expected to open next year, H&M has already opened six stores since October last year and will open an equal number before the year-end.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 15:58:18 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65QFDqur0XqbxsO4", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Integrated Diseases Surveillance Project "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Dr Ramesh Prasad"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Bokaro on "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NVBDCP"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Ranchi Life Savers "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Single Platelet Donors "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SPD"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "RIS "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "RIMS "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Facebook "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "WhatsApp "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Ghera"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Tuesday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "10"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Monday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the last six months"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Last year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "weekly "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Jharkhand "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Jharkhand "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "East Singhbhum"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Jharkhand"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "New Delhi"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bihar "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Karnataka"}, {"code": "FAC", "value": "Muskan hospital"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Jharkhand"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Jharkhand "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Ranchi "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jharkhand "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Rani Kumari"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Prasad"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Monu Prasri"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Atul Ghera "}], "url": "http://feeds.hindustantimes.com/~r/HT-Ranchi/~3/NBVoy5jtRjM/article1-1392586.aspx", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Japanese Encephalitis a bigger threat than dengue: Jharkhand health dept", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:24.483Z", "times": [{"code": "TIME", "value": "Monday night"}, {"code": "TIME", "value": "two-hour "}], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Japanese "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Latehar "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "fifth "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "37 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "17 "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "1-15 years "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "seven "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "first "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "90 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "10 "}], "article": "AVWicgywAi2xnyAOXn6T", "content": "The Jharkhand health department on Tuesday issued an alert spooked by the rise in mosquito-borne Japanese Encephalitis (JE) cases in the state, calling it a bigger threat than dengue.

In the last six months, 37 children in Jharkhand were diagnosed with the infection, of which 17 were diagnosed at the Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (MGMCH) in East Singhbhum.  Transmitted from pigs and wild birds to mosquitoes, JE can lead to severe neurological defects by affecting the central nervous system, leading to tremors and paralysis in humans, said doctors.  \"JE affects children in the age group of 1-15 years and can lead to life-long nerve and neurological defects. It is a bigger threat than dengue in Jharkhand. The virus is dominant in seven districts. We have asked hospitals to be prepared. In rural areas, we have asked people to keep pig sty clean to avoid mosquito breeding,\" said Integrated Diseases Surveillance Project director, Dr Ramesh Prasad. He added that unlike dengue that cannot breed in the hilly terrain, JE is local to the state.  \"Most dengue cases under treatment have contracted the disease in New Delhi, Bihar and Karnataka,\" said Prasad. Monu Prasri, a 14-year-old dengue patient, succumbed to the disease at Muskan hospital, Bokaro on Monday night, making it the first death from the disease in Jharkhand, officials said. Last year, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), 90 children were diagnosed with the disease.  \"The retreating monsoon only increases chances of spurt in cases.

At least 22 others were wounded on both sides, ten of them civilians. Pakistan had closed the border down days before the incident, and tensions had been rising since Islamabad said it would build a gate on the border crossing and fence the two kilometer area to stop Afghan nationals from entering Pakistan without a visa. Kabul had opposed the decision and tried to stop it.  The incoherence of Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy was exposed in the statements that followed.  \u201cMaj [Jawad] Changezi\u2019s martyrdom will be avenged,\u201d defence minister Khawaja Asif said, \u201ceven as our enemies seek to rob us of the peace gains of operation Zarb-e-Azb.\u201d  \u201cPakistan\u2019s sincere efforts for border management are being sabotaged from across the border,\u201d sai Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the interior minister.  Meanwhile, foreign secretary Aizaz Chaudhry told the Senate\u2019s standing committees on foreign affairs and defence, according to reports, that the United States was \u201cprobably upset over the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project\u201d.  Sartaj Aziz, adviser on foreign affairs, said: \u201cThe recent drone attack in which the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor was killed has breached our sovereignty, caused a serious setback to the peace efforts and intensified hostilities in Afghanistan.\u201d  Most of these statements not only belie the art of strategic communication, but also betray the poverty of considered thought on critical issues in a government that is virtually headless and whose sole focus appears to extricate its prime minister from the mess of the Panama Papers.  Pakistan\u2019s current foreign policy focus \u2013 with regard to Afghanistan, India and the US \u2013 is on counterterrorism, border management, Afghan refugees and CPEC.  Washington continues to press for measures against Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, and its congressmen have made roughly 40 percent of security assistance conditional to \u201cdemonstrable action\u201d against the Haqqani network. The drone strike against Mullah Mansoor manifested that pressure.  With Afghanistan, the key issue is border management. Since June 2, every Afghan entering Pakistan requires a visa. The construction of a new gate at Torkham added to the already raging tempers and apparently fanned emotions on both sides. Islamabad defended the move saying it will help stop terrorists crossing over.  However well-meaning, the argument is primarily flawed and self-defeating. It assumes that terrorists transit through regular check points. Some may do so but the majority sneaks in and out through unguarded crossing points. Authorities in Kabul say much more important than check points is the liberty that is available to the Taliban and Haqqani network leaders in mainland Pakistan.  Most Afghans still rigidly insist on calling the border the Durand Line. For them, it is a disputed line subject to final settlement. This issue consumes a lot of time during official and unofficial bilateral dialogues, often with little headway.  Pakistan has thus far found little international support for its latest \u201cborder reinforcement\u201d strategy, and has not been able to take such measures several hundred meters off the border, well within its own territory, either.  The third key issue is the problem of Afghan refugees. The current narrative on the need for repatriation centers on a direct nexus between refugees and terrorism. That is extremely counterproductive.  Over 60 percent of the Afghans living in Pakistan were born here. We can win them over by finding a naturalization mechanism. It can become a potentially huge source of goodwill. One good move would be a renewed biometrics-based census of all the refugee camps with the help of UNHCR, instead of going after or harassing the Afghans who are socio-economically well-integrated into our society.  In China, many were frowning to hear the Pakistani foreign secretary\u2019s statement that the CPEC project had probably upset the US. \u201cIs the US really upset? And If it is, do Pakistani officials really need to state this so publicly?\u201d asked a perplexed Chinese friend, underscoring a bitter reality \u2013 Pakistani leaders and officials talk more than they think.  \u201cPakistan should have the confidence to stand on its own two feet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does it have to present CPEC as a life jacket?\u201d  Senator Saifullah Magsi made a similar statement during that briefing to the standing committee on foreign affairs. \u201cWe need to stop playing the victim and crying for help,\u201d he said, \u201clike a child asking China for assistance.\u201d  The priorities of external players, even China, may change with circumstances, however important they might be. We need to spell out, set and stick to our own priorities, rather than pegging our survival to China. Is anyone listening?

Telegraph picture Imphal, June 19: R. Roni secured 66.8 per cent marks in this year's Manipur High School Leaving Certificate Examination. For the small Kharam community of Manipur, to which Roni belongs, it is no mean achievement and, therefore, a time for celebration. Roni, along with 42 students of the community who passed this year's class X and XII examinations, were felicitated by the Kharam Students' Union, Manipur, at a function held at Tribal Research Institute of Imphal today. Kharam is a small community with an approximate population of 2,000 and is one of the most socially, economically and politically backward communities of the state. Today's felicitation programme marks the start of the community's journey towards \"progress\" by encouraging education among its youths. The community had not counted the success rates of its students in the two most important school examinations till now. But it is agreed that this year's success rate is the highest. Kharam community has only five villages that are scattered in Sadar Hills in Senapati district and Imphal West. \"The community survives on farming. No person from the community has ever held a government job till today as education is lacking because of backwardness,\" the president of the students' union, Khamsoshan Jaichea, said. Of the 46 students of the community who appeared in the two examinations, 42 have passed with high marks. Of the five villages, three have a government primary school and a junior high school each. The schools do not have adequate number of teachers . So the villagers contributed money and appointed temporary teachers for the schools. To encourage students and also to underscore the importance of the programme, the union and Kharam Union, Manipur - the apex body of the community - had invited United Naga Council (UNC) president Gaidon Kamei as the chief guest and the president of the All Tribal Students Union, Manipur, Joseph Hmar, as the guest of honour, to the felicitation programme. \"Your land, culture and identity are god's gifts. If you are not educated you cannot protect god's gifts. You are the hope and light of your community. Pursue your career and take your community forward,\" Kamei urged the successful candidates. While underlining the importance of keeping education out of public movements and strikes, Kamei deplored the dismal education policy of the Manipur government. He said there were no adequate teachers in government educational institutions in the hill districts. He asked the church to be the guiding force in giving education to children. While congratulating the successful candidates, Joseph said education should be the top priority of the community.", "events": [], "date_published": "2016-06-20T18:02:31.656Z"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65cdDqur0XqbxsPF", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Kashmiri Pandits"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Congress "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Congress "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Bharatiya Janata Party "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "BJP "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "BJP "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Rising Kashmir"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "the last few months"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1947"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1990"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1947 to 1987"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1975"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2013"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2015"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "May 2014"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Delhi "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Jammu "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kashmir"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kashmir"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kashmir "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Delhi "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "New Delhi "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Delhi "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Udhampur "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "New Delhi "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Kashmir"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Srinagar"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kashmiris "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mohammad Abdullah "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kashmiris "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Afzal Guru "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mohammad Sayeed "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mufti "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "\u2019s Office "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jitendra Singh "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Omar Abdullah"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mark "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Modi Govt "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kashmiris "}], "url": "http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/a-new-wave-of-insecurity-in-kashmir/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "A new wave of insecurity in Kashmir", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:37.060Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Sainik Colonies"}, {"code": "LAW", "value": "Article 370 and resisting the "}, {"code": "PRODUCT", "value": "Accord"}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}, {"code": "LAW", "value": "Article 370"}], "article": "AVWicg4fAi2xnyAOXn7I", "content": "For the last few months, there has been a palpable anger in Kashmir. This anger defines a new phase of insecurity in the valley.  It follows a series of assertions about setting up something new in Kashmir \u2013 some say separate townships for Kashmiri Pandits, others say Sainik Colonies, some talk about provisions for non-locals in the new industrial policy, and others talk about spaces being created for those who do not have housing facilities.  The colony has become a buzzword in the new discourse that is being shaped mainly by separatists, who were in a disarray and have regrouped under a new but unnamed banner. Whosoever is behind these \u201cnew plans\u201d in Delhi has given them a reason to get united.\u00a0\u00a0But at the same time, it is interesting to note that now the separatists are fighting to protect Article 370 and resisting the moves that they believe are aimed at changing the demography of Jammu and Kashmir.  This state of insecurity in Kashmir has been an inalienable part of its political psyche since 1947. The perceived threat to change the political and social status of the territory has loomed large all through nearly seven decades, and that has resulted in the current, rather long, phase of strife in the state that began in 1990.  Continuous efforts by the Congress to ensure the state\u2019s complete integration at its own will and conditions defied the concept of larger federation that would accommodate divergent views and respect people\u2019s aspirations. They even had double standards in treating Kashmir and Tamil Nadu as sub-national identities. Imposing governments of its own choice and disrespecting institutions of democracy in the state became the hallmark of its policies. From 1947 to 1987, Kashmiris reposed faith in the democratic system despite being wooed by the powers outside to do something different. Even in 1975, when Kashmir\u2019s tallest leader Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah entered into an \u201cunproductive\u201d and rather humiliating Accord, Kashmiris stood by him.  Today when Kashmir is going through a critical process of self-introspection, it needs a larger space to think. But that is not happening. Institutions of various hues are being pushed against the wall, their spaces are being shrunk and an atmosphere of suffocation is being created.  The Congress had put the last nail in this coffin of mistrust by hanging Afzal Guru in 2013. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Delhi did nothing different. In fact, it became more brazen in telling the people that \u201cKashmir has to be conquered\u201d. The way these plans are being unfolded, it seems that New Delhi does not want peace and stability in Kashmir.  In 2015, when Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed joined hands with BJP amid strong reservations from his own supporters, it was expected that new bridges would be built. That did not happen. The way Mufti was made uncomfortable, leading to his unpopularity, BJP showed that it had miserably failed to comprehend Kashmir. The Agenda of Alliance that was worked between the two coalition partners\u2014PDP and BJP- remained just a pamphlet as its spirit was defied.  Soon after the BJP came to power in Delhi in May 2014, Minister of State in Prime Minister\u2019s Office and MP from Udhampur Dr Jitendra Singh announced that the process of the repeal of Article 370 had begun.  Omar Abdullah, who was still the chief minister, reacted strongly on Twitter. \u201cWow, that was a quick beginning. Not sure who is talking. Mark my words & save this tweet \u2013 long after Modi Govt is a distant memory either J&K won\u2019t be part of India or Art 370 will still exist. Art 370 is the ONLY constitutional link between J&K & rest of India.\u201d  The separatists too vowed to fight against the move.  New Delhi might have succeeded in reducing the level of debate from \u201cAzadi\u201d to Article 370, but it has not helped in any way in addressing the discontent and alienation. Kashmir has seen a new breed of militants, almost all of them local, and the way people have been joining funerals of the slain militants also defines a new situation in Kashmir.  Insecurity among Kashmiris is genuinely grounded in the past, and only a future-oriented thinking can do away with it.

Locals have also inscribed names of the victims on the black plaque at the square, giving it a shape of a memorial.  \u201cThere is anger among the residents after the blast. About 2,000 people from various communities gathered four days ago and dismantled the Ahimsa Chowk and renamed it as Shradhanjali Chowk in the memory of blast victims,\u201d said Babulal Muleva, district president of Sirvi community.  Talking to HT over phone from Petlawad, Babulal said the memorial was built without any administrative sanction and marked a reign of people's anger.  \u201cThe administration has not been able to nab the main accused of the blast.

Investigators have confirmed that these accounts were discovered by the police after the the MQM related money-laundering probe started in December 2012.  This correspondent has seen evidence which details each and every bank account linked directly or indirectly with the MQM leader Altaf Hussain or his property concerns. The MQM\u2019s financial chief in Britain and Altaf Hussain\u2019s confidante Tariq Mir has 38 bank accounts in his name.  The MQM has totally denied all the charges of money laundering and blamed its opponents hatching conspiracies against it in this regard.  The BBC said on Friday that the MQM had more than 70 accounts but an investigation by this correspondent shows that the total number of accounts held by the top MQM leadership is over 80.  \u2018Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Ke Saath\u2019 show revealed that the MQM (UK) as a political party had 12 accounts in various banks in London. Papers show that the MQM (UK) has two accounts in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS); four accounts in Barclays; three accounts in Lloyds TSB; two accounts in HSBC; and one account in Bank of America.  MQM\u2019s charity - The SUN (Society for the Unwell and Needy) \u2013 has two accounts in Barclays bank.  Investigators found that the MQM\u2019s leader Altaf Hussain, based in North London\u2019s Mill Hill area, has 26 in his name. Documents show that Altaf Hussain one account in American Express; eight account in Barclays Bank; seven accounts in HSBC; five account in TSB; two accounts in Natwest;\u00a0 two accounts in Rapahel; and one account in Santander bank.  Papers show that senior MQM leader Muhammad Anwar, who is also being investigated for money-laundering along with Sarfraz Merchant, Altaf Hussain, Tariq Mir and others, has only two accounts (in Barclays and HSBC) and these appear to be his personal accounts but subject to investigation.  Scotland Yard inquiries found that senior MQM leader Tariq has 38 accounts in his name. He has six accounts in HSBC; 12 accounts in Santander; four MBNA Europe accounts; two accounts in Barclays; six accounts in Bank al-Falah 6; one account in Allied Bank; two accounts in MCB; one account in Lloyds Bank; one account in National Westminster Bank; one account in Metro Bank; one account in Royal Bank of Canada; and one account in the Nationwide.  MQM\u2019s Euro Properties has three accounts: one account each in RBS and Barclays and one account in Ras al-Khaimah (PSC).  The documents seen by this reporter show how British banks, nudged by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) diplomats, overlooked and violated the rules in allowing so many accounts to the MQM\u2019s exiled leadership. An MQM source told that most of these accounts have been shut down now. The insider said that the MQM has access to only about 5 accounts now and the police was in the loop about these accounts. The source said that lots of MQM\u2019s outgoing bill payments are now made directly from Karachi and Dubai. MQM has paid tens of thousands of Pounds to its law firm Corker Binning and lobbying firm Bell Pottinger but most of these payments were made from Pakistan followed by London accounts. MQM has dismissed Scotland Yard\u2019s claims about the bank accounts.  Papers seen by this correspondent show that Scotland Yard has asked Pakistani authorities if they have any details about the payments made into the MQM linked accounts from Pakistan. Its understood that Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigations Agency (FIA) is currently looking into banking transactions from Pakistan to MQM\u2019s London accounts. Altaf Hussain was arrested as part of the money laundering probe in the middle of 2014 but the money laundering probe started in December 2012 during the course of investigation of Dr Imran Farooq case. Scotland Yard has passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to make a decision whether or not to charge the MQM leadership.  During their investigation into the murder of Mr Farooq the police found \u00a3167,525.92 (about $235,000) in the MQM's offices in London and a further \u00a3289,785.32 in Mr Hussain's home in Edgware, north London. Large cash amounts were also seized from the houses of Iftikhar Ahmad, Sarfraz Ahmned, Sarfraz Merchant and Tariq Mir.  Papers show that Scotland Yard has asked Pakistani authorities to provide any evidence relating to the MQM\u2019s alleged involvement in extortion offences. \u201cSeveral media reports state that MQM is engaged in extortion from the people and businesses in Karachi. It is believed that money is demanded in the form of \u2018chits\u2019 that are delivered to each business. If the money is not paid it is believed that the businessmen and their property are subject to violence. Any evidence of this would assist in identifying potential sources of income for MQM,\u201d says the police request paper, making a mention of the 2012 Baldia factory fire case.  It should be noted that the MQM has time and again rebutted all the charges of extortion levelled by its detractors.  Scotland Yard has also asked Pakistan to provide details of the returns filed by the MQM to the Election Commission of Pakistan. The police wants to see if the MQM broke Pakistan\u2019s electoral laws by not declaring the donations it allegedly received from many sources including allegedly from the Indian spy agency RAW. The police has confirmed that it\u2019s investigation will determine whether the MQM breached the Political Parties Order, 2002, by not declaring the political donations it received.  The MQM has always denied receiving money from India and termed these allegations baseless and politically motivated.  The Scotland Yard documents ask of the FIA authorities: \u201cenquiries be made in Pakistan to obtain copies of the \u2018statement of accounts\u2019 submitted by MQM since 2002.\u201d  \u201cA digital copy of the internal accounting records would be preferable.

It is pertinent to mention here that the sub-committee, under Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, was formed to investigate and present its findings on stone crushing in the area, which were not just causing irreparable environment damage but also health problems for the local residents.  Hundreds of labourers have been rendered jobless at the moment but the closure of stone crushing units is completely in line with the existing laws that never allow this activity in the Margalla Hills National Park.  An official said the offices concerned, including the ICT administration, Iesco and the CDA, started a joint operation starting with cutting power supply to the stone crushing units before dismantling them.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Punjab also informed the court that the mining, crushing and stone blasting activities being carried out on the Margalla Hills were illegal.  A senior official of EPA said stone crushing is not allowed in the Margalla Hills National Park, according to the Islamabad Wildlife Ordinance 1979.

Islamic State-occupied Tabqa air base in the northern part of the country on yesterday, part of a push to try to unseat the extremist group from its de facto capital, Raqqa.  Government forces recaptured the nearby Thawra oil field from IS militants, according to a Syrian journalist Eyad al-Hosain, who is embedded with the army. Activists said yesterday's government assault was accompanied by an aerial campaign on the town of Tabqa, five miles north of the air base. The activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which smuggles news out of IS-held territory, reported that fighter jets struck the town with cluster munitions, killing at least 10 civilians.  The Tabqa base, 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Raqqa, holds strategic and symbolic value in the government campaign on the IS capital. It was the last position held by government forces in Raqqa province before IS militants overran it in August 2014, killing scores of detained soldiers in a massacre they documented on video. Raqqa itself became the militants' first captive city.  A Syrian opposition coalition, meanwhile, called on Turkey to investigate the deaths of at least eight Syrian refugees, including four children, who were allegedly shot dead by border guards Saturday night while trying to cross the frontier.  A statement by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces accused Turkish border guards of firing at a group of civilians trying to cross from Kherbet al-Jouz in northwestern Syria into Turkey's Hatay province, killing 11 people.  The coalition, which relies on Turkish political and financial support, said the incident \"clashes with the generosity displayed by the Turkish government and brotherly people toward displaced civilians.\"  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at eight. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist network, said at least one of those trying to cross was from Jarablus, a northern Syrian town under Islamic State control.  A senior Turkish official said Turkey was unable to independently verify the claims regarding the shooting, but said authorities were investigating.  \"Turkey provides humanitarian assistance to displaced persons in northern Syria and follows an open-door policy \u2014 which means we admit refugees whose lives are under imminent threat,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations.  Later yesterday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement denying that border guards had fatally shot Syrians trying to cross illegally into Turkey.  The Syrian war has pushed over 2.7 million refugees into Turkey, according to the United Nations. Turkey has tightened security along its border in recent months to prevent further inflows. The Observatory says border guards have shot dead 60 refugees trying to cross since the start of this year.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah's TV station Al-Manar broadcast footage yesterday of a fierce aerial and artillery campaign against Syrian rebels, driving the militants to abandon their positions in the thick of the battle.  It said the footage was from the southern Aleppo countryside. Activists reported Saturday that rebels in coordination with al-Qaida militants managed to take two towns in the area, further threatening the government's supply route to its neighborhoods in divided Aleppo city. Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria to back President Bashar Assad's forces and has played a key role in a string of government victories.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 86 pro-government fighters were killed in four days of fighting there. Al-Manar said government forces killed 167 militants, including some two dozen leaders.  Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said yesterday that a Russian soldier has died of wounds he suffered in a militant suicide attack in Syria, the military's 11th casualty since the start of its campaign there.  Sgt. Andrei Timoshenkov died at a hospital at the Russian base in Syria, the ministry said. It said Timoshenkov was protecting an area where the Russian military was handing out humanitarian aid to residents in Homs province on Wednesday and opened fire to stop a vehicle speeding toward the site. The car, rigged with explosives for a suicide attack, blew up, wounding the serviceman. He died the next day in a hospital.  Elsewhere, a suicide blast targeted the entrance to a park in the Syrian city of Qamishli, which is shared between government and Kurdish forces, killing three people, an hour after a memorial was held there for victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide.  \"Had the bombing taken place earlier, there would have been a massacre,\" Qamishli resident and writer Suleiman Youssef told The Associated Press by telephone. Qamishli lies on Syria's northern border with Turkey.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:02:30 +0800"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65t2Dqur0XqbxsPc", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Sharif\u2019s "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Harley "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Saturday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "two weeks "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the coming week"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "London "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "PM "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nawaz Sharif "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "David Lawrence"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Lawrence "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sharif\u2019s "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sharif "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sharif "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sharif "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Pervez Rashid "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Tariq Fatemi"}], "url": "http://www.newspakistan.pk/2016/06/20/doctors-satisfied-pms-recovery-post-surgery/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Doctors satisfied with PM\u2019s recovery post-surgery", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:42.437Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "first "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "first "}], "article": "AVWicg6nAi2xnyAOXn7f", "content": "Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited his doctor for the first time after his surgery, and according to reports, his doctor seems to be satisfied with his post-surgery recovery.

The surgeries were dramatic and invasive, things she hopes her two daughters - Sienna,3, and Jasmine, 9 - won't face as young women.  Promising research published in Nature Medicine today has found an existing drug may prevent breast cancer in the estimated one in 400 women carrying the faulty BRCA1 gene.  The team, led by Australian researchers, has found injections of an inhibitor reduced the proliferation of pre-cancerous cells in BRCA1 breast tissue in mice and three Melbourne women carrying the gene mutation.  Now, the first international human trial is expected to begin within two years.  It could mean cancer prevention for the high risk group of carriers, which includes Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie Pitt, would be reduced to a handful of injections.  The study was led by professors Geoff Lindeman and Jane Visvader from Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, and PHD student Emma Nolan.  They used healthy breast tissue donated by women like Ms Gellie before undergoing surgery to pinpoint cells that give rise to breast cancer in faulty BRCA1 genes.  The researchers discovered these rogue cells could be identified by a marker protein called RANK, a breakthrough that turned their studies towards an existing drug called denosumab.  Denosumab is used as an inhibitor of RANK in osteoporosis and breast cancer that has moved to the bone. When they used the drug on the donated breast tissue, the pre-cancerous rogue cells stopped dividing, or were \"switched off\".  \"By blocking the activity of this RANK receptor we could switch off the proliferation of these cells that are ultimately predisposed to becoming cancerous,\" Professor Visvader said.  Further tests of the inhibitor on BRCA1 mice found two thirds of them did not go on to develop tumours, the research shows.  \"It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk,\" Professor Visvader said.  Professor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said a pilot study of the drug on three human BRCA1 carriers in Melbourne had also shown a significant reduction in the number of dividing cells.  The women had been given a short series of injections.  \"The hope would be that this would either prevent or delay tumour development in BRCA1 mutation carriers,\" Professor Lindeman said.  \"Women who have BRCA1 mutations have few options ... in terms of prevention. The only thing that's really proven is mastectomy, which is highly effective but invasive.\"  He said the next step - large clinical trials - would likely take another decade.  If found to have merit, the injection method would come in time for Ms Gellie's daughters.  \"The women in my lineage don't survive,\" she said.  \"My girls are nine and three and I think that they most probably carry this gene as well because it is very strong in my family.  \"I'm the first generation who will survive and my next step now is to help my girls.  \"Maybe they don't have to go through such drastic measures as I did or maybe it can buy them some time.\"  Before deciding to go under the knife, Ms Gellie was told her chances of developing breast cancer were as high as 80 per cent and she had a 65 per cent chance of ovarian cancer.

Yesterday, the 15-member body heard from Modibo Tour\u00e9, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative and head of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), who warned that the longer the country\u2019s political crisis continues, the more likely the country could see setbacks to its development and economic gains.  In a press statement released today, the members of the Council commended the security forces of Guinea-Bissau for their \u201cnon-interference in the political situation and the restraint shown in this regard,\u201d and reminded the security and defense services of the need to continue abiding by civilian control.  Expressing serious concern over the latest political developments, the Council also commended the peaceful way in which Guinea-Bissau\u2019s population is following the political situation in the country.  In its statement, the Council welcomed the decision taken by the 49th Ordinary Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Authority of Heads of State and Government held in Dakar to designate a presidential mission comprising the Heads of State of Guinea, Senegal and Sierra Leone to meet and conduct discussions with those involved in the political crisis in Guinea-Bissau.  The Council encouraged those regional leaders to further engage in addressing the country\u2019s current political situation. They also welcomed the decision to extend for one year the mandate of the ECOWAS security mission in Guinea-Bissau and, in that respect, commended the decision of the European Union (EU) to provide financial support to the mission.  The members of the Council also encouraged ECOWAS to continue extending its political support to the authorities and political leaders of Guinea-Bissau through the use of good offices and mediation.  Stressing the importance of national reconciliation, inclusive dialogue and good governance, the Council highlighted the need for the Government of Guinea-Bissau to continue to take concrete steps towards peace, security and stability in the country, by effectively reforming the security sector and tackling corruption.  They urged relevant Bissau-Guinean actors to \u201cuphold and proceed with continuous and constructive dialogue, within the established constitutional parameters and with respect for the separation of powers, in order to strengthen democratic governance and work towards consensus on key political issues, particularly with regards to the urgent implementation of necessary reforms,\u201d according to the statement.  The members of the Council recalled their full commitment to support the consolidation of peace and stability Guinea-Bissau and noted that the pledges made at the Brussels International Donor Conference of March 2015 required a stable political environment in order to materialize.  Further, the Council noted that \u201ccourageous and inclusive political steps are needed to help fulfil these pledged commitments, in the best interests of all the people of Guinea-Bissau,\u201d the statement said.

The CPM has lodged a complaint with the Bolpur sub-divisional officer, saying that the 12-cottah pond was being filled up illegally. The complaint, however, did not mention Anubrata's brother Subrata Mondal. The West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act bars filling up of any water body that measures five cottahs or more and where water is retained for a minimum six months. Subrata, a promoter, said he had purchased the pond from a Bolpur family and was filling it up because local youths had demanded that a parking area be constructed there. \"I have bought the pond. It is being filled because local youths want a parking area to be constructed there. What I am doing is nothing but social service. The residents have raised no objection to filling up the pond. I will not make any construction there as it is a registered water body,\" Subrata said. He, however, declined comment when told that filling up a water body was illegal. Anubrata did not take calls from this paper. Sub-divisional officer Shampa Hazra said: \"I have directed the block land and land reforms officer (BLLRO) to inquire into the matter.\" Bappaditya Bandyopadhyay, the BLLRO of Bolpur, said legal steps would be initiated soon as the pond is a registered water body with the land office. Matters related to filling up of water bodies are handled by the fisheries department. Told that the pond is filled up to build a parking area, a fisheries department official said: \"We will have to check whether a complaint has reached us. Then, we will lodge an FIR. If it is found that the filling up is in its preliminary stage, we may ask him to restore the pond.\" Named Tinka Pukur, residents in Kalimohanpally area of Bolpur said the pond had been there for several decades. According to land department officials, the pond measures around 12 cottahs. Residents said though they knew that filling up a water body was illegal, they did not dare protest because of Subrata's \"political connections\". A resident of Kalimohanpally, preferring anonymity, said: \"We know about the filling up of the pond. But we cannot protest as a large number of Trinamul workers have been guarding the place while it is being filled up. Every in Bolpur one knows he is Anubrata Mondal's brother.\" Gautam Ghosh, a CPM district secretariat member in Bolpur, said: \"We have lodged a written complaint with the SDO of Bolpur. The civic body and the local councillor also know about the matter. They are not saying anything against it as Subrata is Anubrata Mondal's brother. We are surprised at this attitude.\" Trinamul MLA Naresh Bauri, who is also the vice-chairman of Bolpur municipality, avoided a reply. \"I am busy in Dubrajpur and can't tell you what is happening there,\" Baruri said, before hanging up.", "events": [], "date_published": "2016-06-20T18:02:20.047Z"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH6427Dqur0XqbxsOU", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "The National Education Workers Coordinator "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CNTE"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The National Security Commission "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CNTE "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Oaxaca "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CNTE"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Asuncion Nochixtlan's "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "days "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "23 "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Asuncion Nochixtlan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Oaxaca "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Oaxaca "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Juchitan "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Enrique Galindo "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Galindo "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Oaxaca "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jorge Alberto Ruiz Martinez"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ruiz Martinez "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gabino Cue "}], "url": "http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/americas/2016/06/21/469936/At-least.htm", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "At least six dead, over 100 injured in Mexico protests", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:21.558Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "At least six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "over 100 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "At least six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "more than 100 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "One "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "28"}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "55 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "eight "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "At least 53 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "At least 21 "}], "article": "AVWicgxCAi2xnyAOXn6E", "content": "At least six dead, over 100 injured in Mexico protests  OAXACA, Mexico -- At least six people were killed, including a journalist, and more than 100 injured in southern Mexico when unknown gunmen opened fire during clashes between police and teachers, authorities said.  The violence erupted Sunday as police fired tear gas at protesters to end a week-long barricade of a road in Asuncion Nochixtlan, a town in Oaxaca state, where some vehicles were set on fire.  The National Education Workers Coordinator (CNTE) union has been leading protests in Oaxaca for days against an education reform and the arrest of two of its leaders.  The National Security Commission initially denied that officers were armed, charging that news pictures showing them with guns were \"false.\"  But federal police chief Enrique Galindo later said that an armed unit was deployed after unidentified people \"fired weapons on police and the population.\"  \"The teachers were not even involved in these things,\" Galindo said at a news conference.  \"There are reports of the presence of various violent groups that have headed the blockades of roads and strategic installations for days,\" the federal and state governments said in a joint statement, urging the CNTE to distance itself from these unidentified groups.  The six fatalities were all civilians, said Oaxaca state public security secretary Jorge Alberto Ruiz Martinez.  Paramedics said that three of the dead had bullet wounds. One was a minor and the other two were 23 and 28. The paramedics spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  It was not immediately clear how the other three were killed.  However the mayor of the Oaxaca town of Juchitan de Zaragoz, where similar clashes occurred, reported that a journalist covering the violence plus one other person had been shot dead.  Authorities did not specify whether the death toll of six included these two individuals.  Another 55 federal and state officers were injured, including eight by gunshots, Ruiz Martinez said. At least 53 civilians were injured.  At least 21 people were arrested.  The CNTE, considered a radical wing of a national union, denounced in a statement the \"repressive action of the federal and state governments.\"  Many of the injured were taken to the Asuncion Nochixtlan's church before being transferred to hospitals. Several are in \"critical\" condition, the government said.  A municipal police officer, who requested anonymity, said a firebomb was thrown on the town's municipal building.  Governor Gabino Cue said the police intervention was needed to restore food and fuel supplies on state roads.", "events": [], "date_published": "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 00:14:00 +0800"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH645LDqur0XqbxsOV", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Abbott "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Abbott "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Facebook "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "O'Farrell"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Labor "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Labor"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Labor Party "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Hewson "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Labor "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "2013"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2013 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2010 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2004 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1993 "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Australia "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Sydney "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Garden Island "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Forde"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Brisbane "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Tony Abbott "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Lindsay"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Fiona Scott"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kevin Rudd "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Donald Rumsfeld "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Rudd "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Barry O'Farrell"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kevin"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Greenway"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Rudd "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Peter Beattie"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Rudd "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Rudd"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kevin "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Julia Gillard-Tony "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gillard "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mark Latham"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gillard "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gillard"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "John Howard"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Latham "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Latham"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Howard"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "John Hewson "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Paul Keating"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Hewson"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mike Willesee "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Keating "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Peter Knott"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Knott "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Keating "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Hewson"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Keating "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Keating "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Knott "}], "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/election-2016-expect-the-unexpected-how-campaigns-are-derailed-by-the-unknown-unknowns-20160508-gom5mg.html", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Election 2016: Expect the unexpected!

Journalists are stockpiling prescription medication.\u00a0And deep in the party machines, campaign managers are working around the clock to make sure absolutely nothing goes wrong.  For 'tis a paradox of election campaigns that while they are 99 per cent tightly managed marvels of media theatre, it is the unexpected events which end up defining them.  This is even more likely in an election where both leaders are campaign neophytes.  In 2013, it was widely assumed that opposition leader Tony Abbott would do something undisciplined and insane to derail his campaign.  In fact, apart from his remark that Liberal candidate for Lindsay, Fiona Scott, had great \"sex appeal\", Abbott kept his crazy inside, preferring, perhaps, to reserve it for his time in government.  Instead, it was the newly re-installed prime minister Kevin Rudd who constantly unleashed what Donald Rumsfeld might term \"unknown unknowns\".  A make-up artist who worked on the prime minister before a television debate against Abbott took to Facebook to complain about him, saying she had \"never had anyone treat me so badly\".  Rudd hauled media to the picturesque Sydney harbourside to announce that he might summarily move the Garden Island naval base to Queensland.  It was a fun idea but he hadn't run it past NSW premier Barry O'Farrell, with whom he had a chance encounter on the foreshore, just before the press conference.  \"Good morning, Kevin. A phone call would have been helpful,\" said O'Farrell, in what probably ended up being the best burn of his career.  A light diversion appeared in the form of the Liberal candidate for Greenway,\u00a0Jaymes\u00a0Diaz, whose crazed mess of an interview with a Channel Ten reporter went viral and reminded us all how much more fun politicians are before they've had media training.  Rudd also used the 2013 campaign to announce the confusing-to-everyone-concerned political comeback of Peter Beattie, as the Labor candidate for the Queensland seat of Forde.  Journalists on the Rudd bus felt their mental health decline in concert with Labor's electoral prospects as the prime minister turned up hours late for press conferences and kept them up late for informal \"chats\".  Towards the bitter end, his media managers openly shrugged when questioned on what Rudd's plan was for the day.  Of course, Kevin was well-versed in campaign disruption, having haunted the 2010 Julia Gillard-Tony Abbott bout like a Dickensian ghost, except more vengeful and with better hair.  That campaign was defined by the unexpected leaks against Gillard \u2013 notably the cabinet leak that she had opposed paid parental leave and an increase in the aged pension.  The internecine Labor war only worsened when former opposition leader Mark Latham, camera crew in tow, muscled up to Gillard when she was on the hustings in Brisbane and demanded to know why the Labor Party had made a complaint about him working for 60 Minutes as a guest reporter.  Funnily enough, in that moment he answered his own question.  It was perhaps one of the few moments in Gillard's life when she felt solidarity with John Howard, whose fingers Latham tried to crunch in a macho handshake during the 2004 campaign.  The gesture, captured by the cameras, came to define that campaign, as it contrasted what many suspected was Latham's lack of emotional regulation with Howard's benign self-possession.  The 1993 campaign pitted opposition leader John Hewson against prime minister Paul Keating. Hewson memorably caught an egg thrown at him during a particularly robust rally and was assailed with whole potatoes at another.  Hewson's election platform was his famous \"Fightback!\" policy, with a proposed GST its centrepiece. He had become famously unstuck when trying to explain to TV interviewer Mike Willesee how the GST would apply to a birthday cake.  It was this weakness Keating sought to exploit when he visited the electorate of Labor MP Peter Knott.  Knott was supposed to hook the prime minister up with a sympathetic cake shop owner, and Keating would use the media opportunity to attack Hewson's birthday cake confusion.  Wires were crossed and Keating ended up being unwittingly led to a hostile baker who harangued him over payroll tax, beneath the full glare of gleeful media.  It is said that Keating forever after referred to Knott as \"the cake shop c---\".", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 09 May 2016 14:00:00 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH64-VDqur0XqbxsOY", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "KD "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "EU "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "EU "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "MENAFN - Kuwait "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "News "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "House "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "KD "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "EU "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "EU "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "century-old "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 23rd "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "century-old "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 23rd "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Kuwait "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bahrain"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "UK "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Italy "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kuwait "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bahrain"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "UK "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Italy "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mohammad Al-Enizi "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nawab Khan "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ahmad Al-Hamily"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mohammad Al-Enizi "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nawab Khan "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ahmad Al-Hamily"}], "url": "http://www.menafn.com/1094819853/Kuwait-KUNA-main-news-for-Monday-June-20-2016?src=RSS", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Kuwait- KUNA main news for Monday, June 20, 2016", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:28.009Z", "times": [{"code": "TIME", "value": "10:33 a.m. "}, {"code": "TIME", "value": "10:09 a.m. "}, {"code": "TIME", "value": "11:17 a.m. "}, {"code": "TIME", "value": "10:33 a.m. "}, {"code": "TIME", "value": "10:09 a.m. "}, {"code": "TIME", "value": "11:17 a.m. "}], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "30 "}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "07:33 GMT"}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Kuwaitis "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "some 30 "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Kuwaitis "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}], "article": "AVWicg0DAi2xnyAOXn6g", "content": "      KUWAIT -- Kuwait Zakat (alms) House launched a KD 103,500-breaking-fast meal projects in some 30 countries (issued at 10:33 a.m. local-time 07:33 GMT)       Economic:       KUWAIT -- KUNA issues feature on Kuwaitis favorite holiday destinations.

In a third incident, a Christian man accused several residents of a village for assaulting him for selling ice cream to Muslims.  In Lahore, hundreds of Christians blocked Ferozepur Road in protest for about three hours on June 12, after they said a policeman beat up a pastor.  A law and order situation was reported that morning in the city\u2019s Fazlia Colony neighborhood \u2013 where about 400 households are Christian \u2013 after a Muslim man living next to the Pentecostal United Church called the emergency police and complained that the church was causing inconvenience by its use of speakers during the holy month of Ramzan, and violating the Punjab Sound Systems (Regulation) Act of 2015.  \u201cFour policemen arrived at the church at about 10:30am and asked for me while the church service was going on,\u201d Pastor Riaz Rehmat told me. \u201cI spoke to them, and constable Muhammad Nawaz, who is on duty at the church every Sunday, told them we did not use a loudspeaker.\u201d  While they were discussing why someone may have raised an alarm, one of the four constables ran towards the church in a fit of anger, wielding his gun. \u201cHe shouted at the worshippers and told them to discontinue the service and stop \u2018making noise\u2019,\u201d according to the pastor. \u201cI went after him and told him to go out of the church. He began to beat me.\u201d  The news spread fast. Congregants from other churches started pouring in and held a protest demonstration on Ferozepur Road.  \u201cIt was Constable Ameer Abdullah\u2019s personal act and does not reflect police policy. He has been suspended from duty,\u201d said Ichhra stationhouse officer Bilal Hanif. \u201cA departmental inquiry has been launched and senior police officers are investigating the matter.\u201d  The man who had made the call, one Shabbir Shah, had made a similar call last week, the police officer said. \u201cWe are investigating that matter as well.\u201d  Shabbir Shah is a Sunni Muslim and has hardliner views, according to the Pastor. \u201cAbout three years ago, he arrived at the entrance of the church gate on a Sunday, before the service had started. He yelled that the music must stop. I told the police and the local political leaders, after which the matter was settled. No criminal case was lodged.\u201d  Two weeks ago, the police briefly apprehended two Christians youths from the Church of Christ, another church in the vicinity, according to Dilraj John, who lives close to the Pentecostal United Church. \u201cThey were detained after someone called the emergency police helpline, but let go in an hour.\u201d  In a separate incident in the Mirpur Mathelo town of Sindh\u2019s Ghotki district, a policeman on guard duty at the district headquarters hospital beat up an 80-year-old Hindu man for eating rice a little while before the breaking of the Ramzan fast.  On Friday, June 10, at about 6:30pm, a man was giving out free rice as alms at a fuel station. Gokhal Das was among the recipients, his son Gobind Ram told me.  The policeman, identified as Ali Hassan Hyderani, had come to buy ice when he saw Gokhal Das. \u201cThe cop asked him why he was eating before Iftar. My father, who is hearing-impaired, could not understand him properly and pointed at the other people.\u201d The policeman began to beat up him with his baton, injuring his head, nose and hand. He was taken to a hospital.  Gobind Ram refuted media report that his father was selling edibles. \u201cHe cannot hear properly and is visually impaired in one eye. He cannot work.\u201d  A first information report was registered against the cop under sections 504, 506/2, and 336 of Pakistan Penal Code at the Jarwar Police Station and he was arrested.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cApart from criminal proceedings, a departmental inquiry has also been launched against him,\u201d Senior Superintendent of Police Masood Ahmed Bangash told me.  Human rights activist Ashok Kumar Bekas praised the policeman\u2019s arrest. \u201cIn Sindh\u2019s villages, scheduled-caste Hindus are treated like animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are forced to work day and night, without rest, and in return they get next to nothing. Landlords treat them as chattel.\u201d  In yet another incident, a Christian claimed that he had been beaten up by a mob for selling ice-cream to Muslim customers, who believe it had become unclean because a Christian had touched it during the sale.  On May 16, Khalil Masih, a 42-year-old father of six, was selling ice-cream on his motorcycle in the Badoke village in Changa Manga, in the Kasur district. \u201cThe wife of local resident Muhammad Boota stopped me and told me I could not sell ice-cream as I was ritually impure and was defiling Muslims by selling my ice cream to them,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cShe warned me not to come back to the village, threatening me with serious consequences.\u201d  Most Pakistani Christians trace their origins to an untouchable caste that was thought to bring ritual impurity to others. That is why many Muslims do not like to eat and drink with them, or use the same utensils \u2013 a practice forbidden in the traditional caste-based system of Hinduism.  Khalil went back to the village to earn his livelihood the next day. \u201cMuhammad Boota\u2019s two sons \u2013 Muhammad Rizwan and Muhammad Farman \u2013 began to beat me up. They took me to the square, where other people joined in and began beating me too, telling me not to sell eatables because I am an unclean Christian.\u201d  He filed a complaint with the police, but said they did not help him. He said a similar incident took place three years ago, but no action was taken.  Changa Manga Police Station House Officer Muhammad Hussain said that the issue had been resolved after a compromise on May 20. He denied religion had anything to do with the matter.  \u201cThe woman says she had asked for five-rupee ice creams, but Khalil said the cheapest ones cost ten,\u201d the officer said. \u201cKhalil told her she would have to spend some money if she wanted ice cream, and that angered the woman.\u201d", "events": [], "date_published": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 03:42:46 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65NMDqur0XqbxsO1", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Congress"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Special "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "National Security Council "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Foreign Office "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Foreign Office "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ISPR "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "TTP "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Haqqani "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Haqqani "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Lashkar-e-Taiba "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "US.

The row \u2013 sparked by the Congress, which scuttled the F-16 fighter sale deal, and the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor in last month\u2019s drone attack \u2013 has ushered in a new low in bilateral ties, which might be well here to stay at least till the new administration takes charge in Washington.  This was evident during last week\u2019s visit by the US delegation comprising Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Amb Richard Olson, Director for Afghanistan and Pakistan at National Security Council Dr Peter Lavoy and top US/NATO Commander in Afghanistan Gen John Nicholson. The delegation\u2019s discussions at the Foreign Office and GHQ were characterized as \u201ccandid and frank\u201d, but yielded little in terms of finding the way out of the bad patch in the relationship. The trip was, nevertheless, symbolic in terms of signaling US commitment to remaining engaged with Pakistan despite the difficulties.  It was not difficult to read the sub-text of the two almost identical statements issued by the Foreign Office and ISPR after the visiting delegation\u2019s two meetings, which rejected the demand for action against Afghan insurgents\u2019 sanctuaries in Pakistan and linked it to border management, repatriation of three million Afghan refugees, and action against TTP sanctuaries on Afghan soil. The Americans, according to a source, were categorically told in the meetings that Pakistan would not start a new war by taking on Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network.  The path out of the crossroads, where the relationship stands now, may not only be difficult to discover, but also tougher one to trek, since there is now virtually a bipartisan consensus emerging in the US that Pakistan has been a duplicitous and dangerous partner, which did not eliminate the Haqqani network, Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba bases from its soil despite having received over $30 billion in aid since 9/11. On the other hand, there is a deepening perception in Pakistan that Washington continues to be indifferent to its security needs and is propping up its archrival India. The assumption that a major Pakistan-US rupture would not happen as both remain indispensable for each other\u2019s interest may not be exactly valid any more. The two may not completely break-off, but the relations would steadily turn cold.  Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz captured the essence of the feeling in Islamabad by observing that there was \u201ca definite non-convergence of interests\u201d between Pakistan and the US. He was testifying before a combined meeting of the Senate committees on foreign affairs and defense. The mood in the US Congress, which has been shaped by the narrative provided by the administration, is no less harsh, with one Congressman likening Pakistan to \u2018Benedict Arnold\u2019 \u2013 the infamous American traitor \u2013 and others criticizing their own government for incentivizing Pakistan\u2019s duplicity by giving money and arms.  It is a fact that the negative developments in Pakistan-US ties are linked to the evolving global and regional scenario, but it would not be wise to ignore the mistakes of Pakistani civilian and military authorities that led the country to this juncture.  A senior official, who has remained part of the bilateral dialogue over the past couple of years, candidly admitted in a background discussion that the Pakistani mistake was to create unrealistic expectations, which have now transformed into frustration on the American side. This, he believed, was exploited by the Indians and Afghans to widen the misunderstandings between Pakistan and the United States.  But there is no dearth of those who tend to simplify the situation by obfuscating ground realities.  Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry, in his verbal statement before the joint sitting of the two Senate committees, said all was going well. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s White House trip had yielded a comprehensive statement and there was an appreciation of Pakistani efforts when Pakistan hosted the Heart of Asia ministerial meeting in December, he said, but all of a sudden things turned bad this year. Surprisingly, no one at the meeting reminded him that reservations about Pakistani security agencies\u2019 inaction against Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network sanctuaries were not new and have regularly featured in US-Pakistan dialogues since Zarb-e-Azb began. Last year, the US Congress deducted $350 million from the Coalition Support Fund reimbursement for Pakistan because the US defense secretary did not certify that action was taken against the Haqqanis and the Taliban.  One possible reason why US took off the gloves now is that the Obama administration has lost hope in settling Afghanistan before it leaves office. Vibes from Washington are that it would increasingly leverage its military assistance and get tougher with Islamabad on the issue of terrorist sanctuaries.  It may probably be too late for the Pakistani government to consider hiring lobbyists on Afghanistan. The damage has already been done. More importantly, image building and improvement in ties with the Congress \u2013 the two objectives stated by Aziz for hiring lobbyist firms \u2013 may not be easy to achieve unless course correction happens here in Islamabad, and we stop thinking it is in US interest that Pakistan and Afghanistan stop becoming safe havens for global terrorists.

This comes as the Aviation Ministry has exonerated itself, saying it is not aware of the disbursement of the funds.  The revelation came to the fore at an investigative hearing on the disbursement and utilisation of N300billion power and aviation intervention fund released by the Federal Government in 2011.  The 10 airlines that benefited from the funds include: Arik Airlines, Dana Airlines, Aero Helicopters, Kabo Air, Caverton Helicopter, Overland Airways, First Nation Airways, Chanchangi Airlines, Odenegene Air and Air Nigeria.   Although the CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele, explained that out of the 10 airlines that benefited from the fund, two of them: Air Nigeria and Chanchangi have become moribund, he failed to list how much each of the airlines collected.  Chairman of the Joint Committee on Aviation and Anti-Corruption, Hope Uzodinma asked the CBN Governor to produce the individual disbursements to airlines within 24-hours.  Represented by an official of the apex bank, Mudashiru Olaitan, Emefiele pointed out that BoI released N500billion in 2011, out of which N200billion and N300billion were disbursed to small and medium scale enterprises as well as power and aviation sectors respectively.  He said out of the amount, N120billion was disbursed to 10 airlines at 7 percent interest rate for 10 to 15 year tenor, adding that while N39.5billion had been recovered so far, N81billion is still outstanding.  The funds, he said, were approved by the Presidency, adding that: \u201cIf the funds hadn\u2019t come, there won\u2019t be any airline flying by now\u201d.  While the chairman, Joint Committee on Aviation and Anti-Corruption, Hope Uzodinma, expressed concern that some of the airlines have become moribund, vice chairman of the aviation committee, Bala Na\u2019Allah, said the funds were transferred to private accounts and diverted to purchase properties in Ghana.  Na\u2019Allah wondered why an aircraft was grounded due to Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) that cost $4,000 after the airline collected N6billion loan.  He said: \u201cThe application of one of the airlines was made in 2010, they had access to it in 2011. As soon as they got access to the money, they transferred huge sums of money to a company in Ghana, apparently to acquire a business in Ghana with the money that is meant to develop aviation in Nigeria.  \u201cThere were other transfers that were non-aviation related in huge amount. What we are saying is that they have collected this money to enhance the growth and development of aviation. Wherein lies the wisdom of making this huge transfer to non-aviation related including transfers across the borders of Nigeria?\u201d  In his submission, Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, said neither the ministry nor its agencies were aware of the disbursement of the funds.  In an interview, Minister of State for Aviation Hadi Sirika, expressed concern that funds were transferred to private accounts and used to purchase properties in other countries.  \u201cIt is a misnomer that the ministry was not involved because if they were meant to boost the aviation industry, the ministry ought to have been contacted or its parastatals, especially the NCAA who have the mandate of economic regulation and oversight over these airlines and aviation business\u201d, he stated.  But other stakeholders at the session like John Nnorom who served as Finance Director of now defunct Air Nigeria, said diversion of N34.5billion loan to Air Nigeria to other ventures led to the collapse of the airline.  He said: \u201cThe N34.5 billion drawn from the fund by the airline was diverted to other personal business by the owner of the airline, Jimoh Ibrahim.  \u201cThe very moment the N34.5 billion intervention fund was paid into the Airline\u2019s account with United Bank for Africa (UBA), it disappeared into one of the private accounts of the owner without \u00a0any amount from the fund injected into the Airline, paving the way for its eventual collapse\u201d.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 17:30:45 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event",

"content": "Ties between Pakistan and the United States are experiencing heavy turbulence these days. The first warning came years ago when the US pressingly insisted that Pakistan should act against the militant groups hiding in its territory. The second when high level officials spoke publicly about distrusting Pakistani military and civilian leadership. \u201cAlthough I would defend them in front of Congress and to the press to keep the relationship from getting worse \u2013 and endangering our supply line from Karachi \u2013 I knew [the Pakistanis] were really no ally at all,\u201d former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates wrote in his book,\u00a0Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.  He also referred to his visit to Islamabad in early 2010 when he met with the Pakistani leadership. Gates said he returned convinced that \u201cPakistan would work with the US in some ways \u2013 such as providing supply lines through Pakistan, which were also highly profitable \u2013 while at the same time providing sanctuary for the Taliban and other extremists, so that no matter who came out on top in Afghanistan, Pakistan would have influence. If there was to be any reconciliation, the Pakistanis intended to control it.\u201d  Gates said further: \u201cMy message was consistent: we were committed to a long term strategic partnership; we needed to work together against the \u2018syndicate of terror\u2019 placing Afghanistan, Pakistan and India at risk; we needed to remove safe havens on both side of the border; Pakistan needed to better control anti-Americanism and harassment of Americans; and the Pakistani army\u2019s \u2018extra-judicial killings\u2019 were putting our relationship at risk.\u201d  These were enough indications for Pakistani leadership to correct the course. The passage of the National Action Plan provided breathing space, and yet the actions have been mostly too little and definitely too late.  Two years later, the US Congress resolved to practice a \u2018carrot and stick\u2019 policy. In March 2015, the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs froze 150 million dollars in Foreign Military Financing and put a hold on the delivery of a number of used Navy cutter vessels. \u201cWe remain deeply concerned that Pakistan has failed to take meaningful action against key Islamist terrorist groups operating within its territory,\u201d the committee\u2019s chairman noted in a letter sent to the State department.  Months later, the Congress first rejected Pakistan\u2019s request to purchase eight F-16 fighter jets, though then it resorted to allow the sale but without any subsidy. \u201cWhile Congress has approved the sale, key members have made clear that they object to using FMF to support it. Given Congressional objections, we have told the Pakistanis that they should put forward national funds for that purpose,\u201d the State Department said after the decision.  This meant that Pakistan would pay at least 700 million dollars for the weapons deal from its national resources. Before the hold, it was supposed to pay around 270 million dollars and the rest from the subsidy. Pakistan missed the deadline to respond and thus the F16 deal was scrapped. \u201cI continue to oppose taxpayer dollars being used at this time to support this sale given that Pakistan is providing safe haven to terrorist groups and refusing to target the Haqqani network, which attacks US troops and threatens the future of Afghanistan,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Pakistan denied such allegations, but half-heartedly. \u201cWe have to use these levers and [have] restricted their movements, restricted their access to hospitals and other facilities, and threatened them that \u2018if you don\u2019t come forward and talk, we will at least expel you\u2019,\u201d Sartaj Aziz told a large audience during his visit to the US. \u201cWe have hosted enough for 35 years, and we can\u2019t do it anymore because the whole world is blaming us just by [Taliban] presence here,\u201d he said.  The commentary was not taken lightly in Washington. The excuse that Pakistan will take action against the Taliban, Quetta Shura or the Haqqani network at its own pace didn\u2019t bode well. This resulted in a unilateral targeted drone strike in Balochistan that killed Taliban leader Mullah Mansour. Pakistan has claimed that the strike violated its sovereignty, but many in the US are wondering if sheltering a Taliban leader wasn\u2019t violation in the first place.  These recent problems have hurt the relationship, forcing the administration to put it on auto-pilot before it could come crashing down. A low level delegation has met with the army chief and others. \u201cThey will talk about some of the recent activities \u2013 that include the strike that took out the Taliban commander \u2013 and our ongoing concerns about security along the border region, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and more broadly our desire to see an Afghan-led and Afghan owned peace process, [\u2026.] or talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government,\u201d the State Department deputy spokesperson John Kirby said last week, adding that talks about other areas of cooperation on counterterrorism with Pakistan were part of discussion too.  Meanwhile, the Congress is planning to decrease military assistance to Pakistan through the National Defence Authorization Act. The House version of the bill calls for blocking 450 million dollars of the 900 million dollars aid, while the Senate version has reduced both the figures to 300 million dollars and 800 million dollars respectively.  The White House, however, has defended the assistance, saying that any imposed condition would \u201cunnecessarily complicate\u201d progress in bilateral ties and would be against the US interest. \u201cWe share the Committee\u2019s concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the Haqqani network and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the need for concerted action specifically against the group,\u201d the White House has said.  The NDAA is due to be amended or passed soon enough. The Obama administration is trying to keep the relationship afloat. The results depend on how the Pakistani leadership acts on its promises.", "events": [], "date_published": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 03:42:45 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65VLDqur0XqbxsO9", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Save One Life "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Gauhati Medical College "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Haemophilia Society "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Haemophilia Society"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "GMCH"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "GMCH"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Telegraph "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "GMCH.

Telegraph picture\u00a0   Guwahati, June 19: The department of clinical haematology of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital will, for the first time, perform corrective surgery on haemophilia patients suffering from physical disabilities within a month. The Guwahati chapter of the Haemophilia Society has provided the department with a million units of factor, a clotting protein administered to haemophilia patients. \"To start with, we will perform corrective surgeries on two haemophilia patients in a month as the clotting protein (factor VIII and factor IX) has been made available by the Haemophilia Society. The department of orthopaedics, GMCH, will assist us in the surgeries on joint disorders,\" Jina Bhattacharyya, professor and the head of the department of clinical haematology at GMCH, told The Telegraph here today. Haemophilia is a genetic bleeding (internal or external) disorder which cannot be permanently cured. The most common parts of the body affected by bleeding are joints and muscles. Prolonged bleeding in the joints and muscles can permanently damage them leading to disability. \"Surgery on haemophilia patients involves a complex procedure as we have to take care to prevent excessive bleeding while the scalpel is at work. In the long run, we will request the state government to arrange for supply of the protein on a regular basis so that the disorder is managed and further damage prevented,\" Bhattacharyya said. Assam has over 1,000 haemophilia patients registered with the GMCH. Unofficial reports say there are a few thousands affected by the disorder in the state. Patients are under-treated or are not treated at all, either because of the high cost of anti-haemophilic factor treatment coupled with lack of awareness. Mukesh Garodia, secretary of Guwahati chapter of the Society, said the World Federation of Hemophilia, the parent body of the Hemophilia Federation (India) of which the Society is a member, has provided a million units of the clotting protein. The federation is a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the lives of people with haemophilia and other genetic bleeding disorders. \"We have requested the federation to provide the factor on a regular basis. The clotting protein is manufactured by pharmaceutical companies overseas and is expensive. A dose (administered in the veins through an injection) comprises 250 units of factor that costs between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,500. The dosage depends on the weight of the patient.\" The Haemophilia Society today awarded scholarships to 31 students from across the state affected by the disorder. \"Save One Life, a US-based NGO has funded the scholarship. We have supported over 50 students with the disorder so far. They are registered with us. The target in the coming phases is to help 200 such students with monetary aid,\" Garodia said. Sources said the disease can also be prevented if diagnosed during the antenatal (before birth) stage. Rathindra Nath Bhuyan, director of Health Services, Assam, said, \"We will ask Dispur to set up a haemophilia clinic in each of the six medical colleges in the state so that the treatment, including physiotherapy, is focused and effective.\" Tezpur MP R.P.

Since the core of our national security strategy is focused on all three countries, it is worth asking who in our civil-military establishment is responsible for this failure of strategic policy.  Let us admit some hard facts. Since independence, Pakistan has been fashioned by the powerful military establishment as a \u201cnational security state\u201d in which law, constitution, economy, democracy and foreign relations are all subservient to a strategic doctrine of \u201cnational security\u201d defined by the military in which India has figured as the perennial arch-enemy. This doctrine and the consequent national narrative that flows from it is embedded in the national consciousness by virtue of the military\u2019s direct political over-lordship of state and society during three decades of rule by Generals Ayub Khan, Zia ul Haq and Pervez Musharraf and indirect stewardship when corrupt, inefficient and weak civilian rulers have been in office. Indeed, whenever the military has seized power from the civilians it has cited \u201coverwhelming national security concerns\u201d as a key motive. In fact, all the key foreign policy decisions since independence have been taken by the powerful military establishment while the weak and divided civilians have meekly acquiesced. These include the anti-USSR Cold War alliance with the US, pushing East Pakistan into secessionist mode, sponsoring jihad against USSR in Afghanistan in the 1980s, triggering war and conflict with India on four occasions, playing favourites in Afghanistan by installing the Taliban in Kabul in 1997 and giving them safe havens in Waziristan after 9/11 in pursuit of another national security offshoot doctrine of \u201cstrategic depth\u201d. As a consequence, the military has also nourished non-state jihadi and sectarian actors for \u201cliberating\u201d Kashmir from India and opposed trade and peaceful co-existence with India. As a result any potential economic dividend from peace with neighbours has eluded Pakistan.  To be fair, however, the fact also is that since General Musharraf\u2019s time the military establishment has been critically reviewing its national security doctrine and making significant adjustments in view of changing geo-political realities. After 9/11, it abandoned the doctrine of \u201cstrategic depth\u201d in Afghanistan. In 2005, it realized the futility and negative consequences of sponsoring jihad in Kashmir and slowly turned off the tap. In particular, it abandoned the \u201ccore\u201d idea of \u201cKashmir banay ga Pakistan\u201d. By the time General Ashfaque Kayani retired in 2013, the military\u2019s national security doctrine had also abandoned the cherished notion of a \u201cpro-Pakistan\u201d Afghanistan and settled on sponsoring a neutral Afghanistan that would not be hostile. Most significantly, the national security doctrine now postulated the \u201cenemy within\u201d (religious terrorism) as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to state and society and not the external enemy India. Operation Zarb-e-Azb is a natural and powerful exposition of this doctrine by General Raheel Sharif. These developments amount to an evolving paradigm change in the outlook of the military in Pakistan.  Unfortunately, however, the historical burden of distrust and double-dealing among the key players in this region \u2013 Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and the US \u2013 is creating stubborn obstacles in the way of this process of stabilising Pakistan and the region. The key players in Afghanistan are all agreed on a joint multi-lateral approach to establishing peace in Afghanistan but each wants to put the onus of core responsibility (\u201cdo more\u201d) on the others. This is a major source of tension between the Pakistani military establishment and the other regional players, especially America and Afghanistan. Internally, the civilians and military in Pakistan are also, finally, on the same strategic page. But much the same burden of historical civil-military distrust has muddied the waters and lead to tensions and frustrations.  This is the context in which we should address the question of \u201cwho makes foreign policy\u201d and who is responsible for its success or failure in Pakistan. The military says it simply gives its \u201cinput\u201d into the making of foreign policy for which the civilians are ultimately responsible. But the civilians say with greater justification that the military is the key determinant of policy because the instruments of its implementation are squarely in its hands. If the civilians wanted the military to attack the Haqqani network and push it out of Pakistani border lands or if the civilians ordered it to drag the Afghan Taliban to peace negotiations (as demanded by the regional players), of if they wanted it to disband the jihadis and help the government confront the radical religious outfits, would it be able or willing to do so? If the civilians wanted to make unilateral trade and overland concessions to India in a non-sum zero game, would the military agree or would it sabotage any such initiative?  Therefore this is not a matter for a full time civilian foreign minister to redress as opposed to a coterie of foreign policy advisors. This is really about elected civilians demonstrating greater know-how, ability and vision to steer the country out of troubled waters as much as it is about the military relinquishing its grip over national security tactics and strategy.", "events": [{"code": "EVENT", "value": "USSR Cold War "}, {"code": "EVENT", "value": "9/11 "}, {"code": "EVENT", "value": "9/11"}], "date_published": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 03:42:43 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65zhDqur0XqbxsPi", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Occidental "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Victorias City "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mead "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mead "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mead"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the National Police Commission "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mead "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mead "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Philippine National Police-Regional Headquarters"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "two-day "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the second day "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "May 20 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 13"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "MANILA"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Philippines "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Negros "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Negros Occidental "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Frederick Mead "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Marvin Gustilo"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gustilo "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gustilo "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "William Se\u00f1oron "}], "url": "http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/21/1595094/negros-cop-used-shooting-target-superior", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Negros cop used as shooting target by superior", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:22.948Z", "times": [{"code": "TIME", "value": "the morning of May 19 at "}], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "first "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}], "article": "AVWicgx9Ai2xnyAOXn6M", "content": "MANILA, Philippines - A police superintendent and officer-in-charge of a city police station in Negros Occidental is facing charges for allegedly using one of his men as his target during practice shooting.

Reports said the incident occurred on the morning of May 19 at the Victorias Shooters Association Target Range in Barangay 21.

On the second day of training, Mead was showing his men how confidence firing is done.  Gustilo reportedly volunteered to hold the three balloons, which were Mead\u2019s targets. He held two of the balloons with his hands and the other between his knees.  Mead was able to hit the first two balloons, but missed the last one, hitting Gustilo instead in the right knee.  He was relieved on May 20 and reinstated on June 13, after the conduct of an investigation.  His reinstatement was based on a policy of the National Police Commission prohibiting the relief of a police officer with a pending case.

That's how senior Victorian Liberals sum up the party's election chances in the state with Malcolm Turnbull leading.  The parochial footy-mad state never embraced his Sydney-centric brand of conservatism, so when Mr Turnbull won, Victorians were pleased. The idea of a more socially progressive, urbane Australian giving public transport a fair hearing provided\u00a0an antidote to Mr Abbott.  Overnight the Victorian Liberal Party switched from defence to offence, eyeing off two \"middle-class marginal\" seats held by Labor -\u00a0Bruce and Chisholm - and the ALP moved\u00a0from a war footing to a strategy of sand-bagging seats.  Despite the renewed Liberal hope, few strategists believe many seats will change hands, given many voters have been disappointed by Mr Turnbull's short reign\u00a0and Victoria's\u00a0relative shortage of swing seats.  Fairfax-Ipsos polls show his approval rating in Victoria dropping from 69 per cent in October to 54 per cent in April. His disapproval\u00a0rating has doubled to 36 per cent in the same period.  Labor is once again on the attack, eyeing off Corangamite, La Trobe, Deakin and Dunkley:\u00a0successful field campaigns used at the 2014 state election will again be run by the party and Trades Hall.  Sarah Henderson's Corangamite (3.9 per cent) shapes as the seat most likely to change hands. Once a conservative rural stronghold, Geelong's expanding urban boundaries, combined with population growth in Torquay and the Bellarine Peninsula, has changed the demographics and\u00a0made the seat marginal.  And with Ford closing and Alcoa closing it doors, job security and cost of living are front of mind.  Labor hardheads are nervous about eastern suburban seats Chisholm (1.6 per cent) and Bruce (1.8 per cent), while Dunkley (5.6 per cent) looms as Labor's dark horse \u2013 Bruce Billson's retirement has made the seat marginal with his personal brand worth 2-3 per cent.  Victorian voters have different priorities to other states. The \"stop the boats\" policy has never resonated strongly\u00a0and the monthly Ipsos issues monitor shows health is the number one priority for Victorians.  Nationally, the most pressing issue for voters is the economy. In Victoria, that issue ranks eighth, so it will be interesting to see how\u00a0the Coalition's focus on transforming the economy resonates in this\u00a0state.  Following health, Victorians\u00a0care about transport, crime, drug abuse and housing, issues that Labor loves to talk about.  It is no surprise that transport ranks highly given the constant politicking over how to solve Melbourne's traffic woes.  Mr Turnbull is a\u00a0keen public transport user, but his focus on road funding through an unsolicited pledge of $1.3 billion for freeway expansions, not to mention his revival of the\u00a0East West Link, is aimed at voters in marginal eastern suburbs seats.  Victoria has been tough territory for the Coalition; it has only topped the two-party preferred vote in the state twice since Bob Hawke was elected, in 1990 and 2004.\u00a0The latest Fairfax/Ipsos poll shows Labor with a 53-47 lead in Victoria.  Even at Julia Gillard's lowest ebb, Victorians backed her over Mr Abbott - although this parochialism has not been extended to the Melbourne born-and-bred\u00a0Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten.  Last election, the Liberals won just three seats despite the national swing \u2013 it also lost Indi to independent Cathy McGowan. In 2010 just three seats changed hands, Labor winning McEwen and La Trobe and the Greens wrestling\u00a0 Melbourne from\u00a0the ALP.  And while it is hard to see Victoria as election-defining it does toss up intriguing individual battles.  In Murray, Liberal MP\u00a0Sharman Stone's eleventh-hour retirement has given the Nationals an opportunity to seize back territory that is historically theirs \u2013 it was the home of 'Black Jack' John McEwen \u2013 and opened the door for a strong independent.  Next door in Indi Sophie Mirabella is trying to mount a political comeback against Ms\u00a0McGowan \u2013 her frank admission about funding for Wangaratta hospital has already captured national attention, and is a sign of how many people will be watching Indi just for the sport.  And in inner city Melbourne, the powerbase for the Greens, the party is striving to make inroads in Labor-held Batman, Wills and Melbourne Ports and the Liberals' Higgins.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 09 May 2016 14:00:00 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH66ATDqur0XqbxsPw", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "the Sindhi Aurat Tanzeem "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SAT"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Council of Islamic Ideology "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CII"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SAT "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SAT\u2019s "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Peoples\u2019 Party "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CII "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Shah Latif Chair"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "University of Karachi"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Dr Fahmida Hussain "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Islam "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "every week "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Sindhi "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Zahida Dahri"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Saeeda Gopang"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Prophet "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jirgas "}], "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheNewsInternational-Karachi/~3/OCUZyc3Wwck/129113-Activists-demand-abolition-of-CII", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Activists demand abolition of CII", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:36.772Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Islamic "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Arab "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Sindhi "}], "article": "AVWicg4UAi2xnyAOXn7G", "content": "A conference held by the Sindhi Aurat Tanzeem (SAT), on Sunday, terming the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) outdated, unconstitutional and regressive, demanded for it to be abolished.

The event was presided over by SAT\u2019s president, Saeeda Gopang, and attended by a large number of women activists.

Only girls\u2019 education could empower women to fight for their socio-economic and political rights, the resolution further maintained.

The insurgents also claimed a second, smaller blast in south Kabul targeting a local politician that the interior ministry said killed one person and injured five others, including the politician.  The Kabul blasts were followed just hours later by an attack on a market in the remote northeastern province of Badakhshan that authorities said killed at least eight people and wounded 18, with the death toll set to rise.  The wave of violence comes ten days after Washington announced an expansion of the U.S. military's authority to conduct air strikes against the Taliban, a significant boost for Afghan forces who have limited close air-support capacities.

On the other hand Gulfam denies the charges levelled against him saying, \u201cThis is true that Gondal was known to me for quite long but when a case came against him I did investigations according to the merit and I have nothing to do with receiving money,\u201d he told The News.  Gondal was arrested following a case registered in FIA on December 26, 2014. In the case FIA blamed Gondal for playing role of a frontman in giving land compensation cheques to the locals of Moza Noon of Islamabad in connivance with officials of Capital Development Authority (CDA).\u00a0 The case against him is still pending before the special central judge of Islamabad. After two months and ten days detention, Gondal got bail and started attempts to get his money back which his brothers reportedly gave to the FIA officials.  In October 2015 on the directions of the interior minister, Gulfam was removed from the FIA on charges of corruption according to the statement issued by the spokesman of the Interior Ministry at that time. Despite having a questionable record Gulfam not only got induction in Police Service of Pakistan group but is currently serving in Gilgit-Baltistan as Senior Superintendent of Police.  Gondal in his application, a copy of which is available with this correspondent, claims that Gulfam while using his position as head of Anti-Corruption Circle of FIA falsely dragged him into a fake case.  Gondal says that he was a small time property dealer in Islamabad and the said officer was his friend as both of them used to hail from the same area in Punjab.  He says Gulfam developed differences with him on an issue of the sale of his multimillion plot located in Iqbal Town. Gulfam, he said, wanted his plot to be exchanged with a commercial property and I failed to make the deal as it was not a profitable deal for the second party.  Gondal says in year 2014 Gulfam assumed the charge of deputy director of FIA's Anti-Corruption Circle and that was the time when his troubles started. He said that first Gulfam falsely dragged him in a CDA corruption case.  \"FIA men arrested me from the district Katchehry, Islamabad, when I was in the mid of another deal. I was taken into custody without being informed of the charges and without due process of law. While I was there for a property deal, I had an amount of Rs1.22 million in my car which was recovered by the raid party led by FIA's sub inspector Naeem Niazi. Todate there is no clue to my money. I was taken to FIA police station Iqbal Town, Islamabad. Later my 15 days remand in different times was taken. During the remand I was taken to Gulfam's office where he ordered tea with biscuits and directed others to leave the room. When others left he directly demanded Rs20 million. I refused as I did not have the money. Later Inspector Irfan Azeem Burni, who is still serving as Sub House Officer (SHO) of Anti-Corruption Circle of FIA, demanded Rs10 million. I was sent to jail but Gulfam started harassing my family and my brothers. My brothers bowed down before him and paid him Rs3 million through Mumtaz Bosal, an Islamabad police Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI). Bosal is a long time frontman of Warraich. Later FIA inspector Burni received Rs .6 million directly from me for de-freezing my bank accounts.\u201d Burni denies this allegation saying that he had arrested Ghulam Sarwar on a solid case. Burni added, \u201cGondal was an accused who has started circulating baseless allegations against him.\u201d  Gondal says that he approached the FIA for justice. Instead of giving justice some officers harassed him but he is determined to get justice. He appealed to Ch Nisar Ali Khan, Federal Minister for Interior, to personally look into this matter and ensure punishment to the culprits and return of his hard earned money.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH640uDqur0XqbxsOS", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Agri Forum Pakistan"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "National Food Security "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Research "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Farmers "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Punjab Agriculture Minister "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Flour "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Pakistan Flour Mills Association"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "this year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "this year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "last year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2011"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the current fiscal year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2014"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "last year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "January "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "January 2013"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "past years "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "next year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2007"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the last days "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the last five years"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Lahore"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Punjab"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Punjab"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ibrahim Mughal"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mughal "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Muhammad Mohsin"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Farrukh Javed "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Shaukat Aziz "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Asim Raza"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ali Ahmed Aukak"}], "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2014/03/23/Low-price-supports-may-be-souring-Pakistani-farmers-on-wheat/81390307033437/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Low price supports may be souring Pakistani farmers on wheat", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:42.713Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "MONEY", "value": "about $11.50 "}, {"code": "PERCENT", "value": "14 percent "}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "about $10"}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "British "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "21 million acres"}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "21.4 million "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "22 million "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "25 million tons "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "24 million tons "}, {"code": "PERCENT", "value": "11 percent "}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "$312 to $277 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "nearly a half-million "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "about 273 pounds "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "almost 24.8 million "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Pakistani "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "an estimated 500,000 "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "700,000 tons "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "1.2 million tons "}, {"code": "PRODUCT", "value": "Wehari "}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "22 rupees "}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "21 cents"}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "10.35 rupees "}], "article": "AVWicg6yAi2xnyAOXn7h", "content": "Farmers in Pakistan, a country with the potential to produce enough wheat for domestic consumption and export, seem to be losing interest in growing the grain because the government has failed to prop up prices high enough, growers\u2019 representatives say.  A government decision this year raised the wheat support price to about $11.50 for about 90 pounds, a jump of 14 percent over the previous price of about $10, the Crop Site, a British website that tracks commodity developments, says. Still, total acreage planted this year slipped to 21 million acres, down from 21.4 million last year and 22 million in 2011.  The support level has been controversial in Pakistan.  Ibrahim Mughal, president of Agri Forum Pakistan, a national farmers' association based in Lahore, told UPI Next the government's wheat price is too low and Pakistan will join the wheat import club, which would be unacceptable for an agrarian country.  \"Because of the low price, wheat production for the current fiscal year has already decreased and it will leave no other option except to import wheat,\" he said.  The government has set a production goal of 25 million tons for 2014. Index Mundi, a site that tracks production and commodity prices, says Pakistan produced 24 million tons of wheat last year. Wheat prices in January were 11 percent lower than they were in January 2013, when the price dropped from $312 to $277 a ton, Index Mundi says.  After earlier projections that production would likely come up nearly a half-million tons short of the goal, recent timely rains have National Food Security and Research officials predicting the target will be met.  Mughal said per-capita wheat consumption in Pakistan is about 273 pounds of wheat a year, meaning almost 24.8 million tons of wheat must be produced annually for Pakistani domestic needs alone. Additionally, an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 tons of wheat is required for poultry feed and another 1.2 million tons is needed to seed the subsequent year's crop.  Farmers are not as interested in growing wheat as they were in past years because they consider the set price too low, Muhammad Mohsin, leader of the Kissan Itehad Council, a farmers' association, told UPI Next.  \"The continuously increasing cost of seeds, pesticides, electricity and fertilizer has already disheartened us and we know that the government is unable to help us in reducing these prices. So we just need the wheat prices to be increased so that farmers can acquire some profit out of their hard work,\" he said.  Farmers contend the price set by the government is less than the cost of production, making it difficult to achieve the target output, not just this year, but also next year.  Farmer Tariq Bajwa, speaking with UPI Next by phone from the Wehari district of Punjab, said he was concerned that foreign exchange will be used to make the purchase if the government decides to import wheat.  \"We have to buy expensive fertilizer, pesticide, seed and even expensive water to saturate crops,\" he said.  Punjab Agriculture Minister Farrukh Javed told UPI Next that as a farmer he agrees with the demands of the wheat growers, but as a minister he needs to take into account wheat prices that will attract buyers.  He said escalating production costs plus the goods and service tax -- similar to a value-added tax -- must be cut to help struggling wheat farmers.  \"The government has already lowered electricity prices from 22 rupees [21 cents] to 10.35 rupees which will, of course, benefit them. In addition, negotiations are being made with fertilizer and pesticide companies to reduce prices, but it will be difficult to announce the time frame of this primary stage,\" he said.  Flour prices are also linked to the wheat supply. Flour mill owners are concerned that a shortage of wheat could cause price hikes and provoke a mass panic similar to one that occurred in 2007, during the last days Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz was in power.  Flour mill owners want to see an increase in the wheat support price set by the government or a decrease in the price of goods like fertilizer and pesticides as farmers demand.  Javed told UPI Next the government is trying to negotiate a drop in fertilizer and pesticide prices. In addition, the government is also considering a GST or VAT subsidy.  \"The government should have a backup plan if shortages hit the market, because we will not have the ability to maintain flour prices,\" Asim Raza, chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association, told UPI Next.  \"Flour prices depend upon the wheat supply and demand. If flour mill owners get expensive products, buyers will have to buy costly flour,\" he said.  This is what has been done for the last five years, despite population growth, Ali Ahmed Aukak, former minister for agriculture in Punjab, said.  \"The government needs to provide farmers with some incentives and also with the deduction inputs' prices subsidies so that they can feel encouraged to produce wheat not only to meet national demand, but also to export wheat for foreign exchange,\" he told UPI Next.", "events": [], "date_published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 15:16:34 -0400"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65IPDqur0XqbxsOw", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "The Lagos State Government "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the State Government "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Waterfront Infrastructure Development"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Monday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Last weekend"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "LOC", "value": "the Ogun River"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Adebowale Akinsanya"}], "url": "http://businessdayonline.com/2016/06/keep-off-ogun-river-blocked-by-vegetation-lagos-warns-residents/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Keep off Ogun River blocked by vegetation, Lagos warns residents", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:41.009Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [], "article": "AVWicg6HAi2xnyAOXn7Z", "content": "The Lagos State Government on Monday warned residents to keep off the Ogun River, near the Kara Cattle Market which was recently blocked by vegetation, saying that the river could open up at any time with dire consequences.

Residents in the area were stunned by the incident and turned the area to a tourist site of some sort, with some residents seen walking on the blocked river and taking pictures.  But the State Government in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Waterfront Infrastructure Development, Adebowale Akinsanya, said it was dangerous for residents to besiege the dry area as the flow of the river was still active beneath.  He said, \u201cIt is important to notify the public that have been worried about the environmental consequence of a dried up river to note that the flow of the river is still active beneath the vegetation and the situation is been evaluated.  \u201cHowever, because of the compacted nature of the vegetation residents and onlookers are of the erroneous belief that the river has suddenly dried up and can walk across the vegetation.  \u201cA lot of people that have turned the place to a tourist destination are unaware of the danger lying ahead.

(Ma\u2019am, you helped me talk to my mother. Now, will you also send me to Pakistan ?)\u201d a joyous Mohammad Ramzan said when he met this correspondent on Tuesday morning.  Ramzan, 15, was separated from his mother when his father Mohammad Kazol took him to Bangladesh and remarried. Harassed by his stepmother and neglected by his father, Ramzan left his home and crossed over to India about two-and-a-half years ago after his friends advised him to travel to Pakistan via India.  After entering India, he travelled to Ranchi, Mumbai, New Delhi and other cities before he was caught by the Railway Police in Bhopal and handed over to a shelter home in October 2013.  Ramzan, who was depressed and hopeless two weeks ago, now appears to be optimistic. After the Hindustan Times reported about him, Ramzan found a real \u201cBajrangi Bhaijan\u201d in Bhopal in Hamza Basit, a 20-year-old student of chartered accountancy.  Unlike the character played by Salman Khan \u2013 who helps reunite a hearing and speech impaired girl with her family in Pakistan \u2013 Basit used technology and social media to convey Ramzan\u2019s plight across the border. Basit circulated the news report with some additional information on social networking sites.  Pakistani journalist Syed Talim Rasool contacted Basit through WhatsApp and provided the phone numbers of UNICEF and child protection unit coordinator Aamir Murtaza.  Ramzan had said his home was in Moosa Colony of Karachi and Pakistani activists pasted posters with Ramzan\u2019s photo in the neighbourhood and surrounding areas.  One of the posters was spotted by the man who had married Ramzan\u2019s mother. His mother, Begum Razia, then contacted Ramzan through the man in whose house she works as a maid.  Ramzan said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my ears when I talked to my mother on the phone after five years. I also talked to my sister Zora and my friends in Moosa Colony of Karachi.\u201d  Sharing his happiness, he said, \u201cMy mother was not aware that I ran away from my father\u2019s house (in Bangladesh) and reached India.

I told her that I eat dal chawal here and she said, \u2018Beta achche se rehna, kahin jana nahi, mein tumhe Pakistan bulaungi or tumhara manpasand non-veg khilaungi.\u2019  \u201cMy mother has been talking to me over phone for the past three days,\u201d he added.  Basit said he had decided to help reunite Ramzan with his mother after reading the report in Hindustan Times . He credited several people for the breakthrough in establishing contact with the teenager\u2019s mother.  \u201cI circulated the news with some additional information through Facebook and WhatsApp. Those who helped me contact Ramzan\u2019s mother include Pakistan resident Syed Talim Rasool, the UNICEF unit in Karachi, child protection unit coordinator Aamir Murtaza, social welfare officer Tahir Mehmood, Karachi child protection unit psychologist Rizwana Jubeen and the Childline director in Bhopal, Archana Sahay,\u201d he said.  Aamir Murtaza told Hindustan Times on phone from Karachi, \u201cWe came to know about Ramzan through a report in Bhopal. We pasted posters of Ramzan at Moosa Colony. Ramzan\u2019s mother has also remarried.  \u201cThe man identified him and informed us over phone. Ramzan\u2019s family is a refugee family from Bangladesh. Ramzan\u2019s mother is extremely happy after finding her son. Now, we are going to initiate the process through the social welfare department of Pakistan to allow Ramzan to live with his mother.\u201d  Childline director Archana Sahay said, \u201cI am extremely happy that Ramzan talked to his mother after two years of hard work by us, but without the HT report it could not have been possible. Pakistan\u2019s social welfare department secretary and child protection unit contacted us from Karachi. They have sent us a mail and photographs as proof.  \u201cI contacted the joint director of the women and child welfare department here in Bhopal. The joint director asked us to send details. After getting these, they will send it to the home department for initiating the process,\u201d she added.

On Tuesday evenings, she takes calligraphy and then English lessons. Saturdays bring a preparatory class for a middle school entrance exam.  Now she is also considering picking up a violin class.      Xinyu's overbooked schedule is not unique in China, where cram school and extracurricular classes are common. Although China -- the country known for its hard-driving parents who spawned the moniker Tiger Mother -- achieves top results on international standardized tests, many parents, students, teachers and even the country's leaders agree that pressure on children has gotten out of hand.      Now the government is at work on a new measure to try to de-emphasize cramming, but such attempts have fallen flat in the past -- parents are afraid of letting their children fall behind in a country of 1.35 billion, where competition for top schools and jobs is intense.      \"Parents can't risk their children's future for their childhood happiness, although parents feel heartache seeing their children suffer,\" said former elementary school teacher Qing Fu, who now works for a famous Beijing cram school.      Four leading institutions of this type in China, New Oriental, Tomorrow Advancing Life, Ambow and Xueda, all listed on the New York Stock Exchange, have more than 1,000 learning centers in 80 major Chinese cities. New Oriental generated $675 million in revenues in 2012, a figure that rose to $857 million last year, its annual reports show.      The emphasis on studying apparently has benefits. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Program for International Student Assessment, said in December that Shanghai 15-year-olds ranked first among those from 65 participating countries.      The program, however, showed that Shanghai students spend nearly 14 hours per week on homework and cram school work, the most among the countries covered.      China's government is working on a plan to ease the burden. One proposed measure, a draft copy of the plan reveals, says elementary schools should no longer offer after-school cram classes, although the plan doesn't challenge the powerful, profit-making learning centers.  The government has solicited advice from families on the plan and released it publicly. It is certain to go into effect, although its implementation date has not been announced.      Xia Ge, Xinyu's mother, seems underwhelmed by the effort.      \"Polarization between good middle schools and bad middle schools is severe,\" she said, speaking Chinese.  \"As long as the government doesn't release a policy to radically reform the polarization, it is no use to just claim they are easing children's burden.\"  Her daughter is staying put in her extracurricular lessons.      Yunshan Liu, a Peking University education professor, said China's Education Ministry is under great pressure to try to offer each child an equal shot at success, but said \"education can never reach fairness and equity.\u201d  \u201cIt is actually about individualism,\u201d the professor said. \u201cSome individuals can change their fate via education. When a large majority of people want to pursue this goal while education resources do not increase proportionally, however, competition in education can only become even more intense,\" she said. Liu added that her point of view on extracurricular classes is neutral - they are simply a fact of life in China.      John Xi, a 10-year-old who goes to two cram schools every week for math and English, has special interests in paper planes and robots.      \"I would read encyclopedias and books about robots, design and make paper planes, and go-kart race with my best friend, Haoyuan, if I could do as I wish on weekends, instead of cramming,\" he said.      When his mother stepped away, he whispered: \"I don't like going to cram schools at all. My mother forces me to take those lessons.\"      Fang Gao, his mother, said that if she had a choice she would not send her son to cram classes.      \"I want him to do things he likes in his spare time,\" she said. \"Most parents hold the same opinion. However, we don't have choice. Most families have only one child due to the one-child policy.      \"Thus, we don't want to risk letting our only child lose at the very beginning.\u201d      Liu said \"don't lose at the very beginning\" is a well-known slogan -- and one created by cram schools.", "events": [], "date_published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2014 14:22:02 -0400"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65d_Dqur0XqbxsPH", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Silchar"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Citizens' Rights Preservation Committee"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Assam"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Bidhayak Das Purkayastha"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Sheikh Hasina-led "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Bengali Hindus "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Assam Samajwadi Party "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Gauhati High Court "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Choudhury "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "June 19"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the past few weeks"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Naharpunj "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Srimangal"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bangladesh"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bangladesh "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bangladesh "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Bangladesh "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Hafiz Rashid "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ahmed Choudhury "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Narendra Modi "}], "url": "http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160620/jsp/northeast/story_92188.jsp", "date_collected_as_date_published": true, "title": "Worry over 'eviction' in Bangladesh", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:38.435Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "700 "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Hindus "}], "article": "AVWicg5LAi2xnyAOXn7O", "content": "Silchar, June 19: A civil rights organisation today expressed its concern over the alleged eviction notice served to 700 Khasi families residing in Naharpunj sub-division in Srimangal, Bangladesh.

Officials said on Tuesday that the analyser machine at the biochemistry department of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) broke down on Monday.  The RIMS, the only state-run super-specialty hospital in Jharkhand with a daily patient footfall of around 1,500, offers critical treatment facilities in its 30 different departments.  Though pathological services are available at all major state hospitals, RIMS has the largest range under one roof -- facilities for 31 tests compared to 20 in other hospitals.  The RIMS pathology lab conducts tests on more than 1,000 patients admitted to the hospital and almost 600 out-patients daily, according to officials.  RIMS officials said that more than 100 samples due for simple blood tests and complicated tests of billirubin, alkine phosphate, blood urea and creatinine tests had been sent back from the bio-chemistry department after the machine stopped working.  More than 200 patients have also been sent back since Monday, forcing them to get their tests done at costlier private clinics in the periphery of the RIMS campus in Ranchi.  A lab technician said on the condition of anonymity said that the analyser, a machine that can tests samples for multiple parameters, had gone bust due to poor maintenance and hospital authorities had failed to get in touch with specialised teams trained to repair it. The machine was installed in 2010.  Doctors said that the worst affected will be the patients from lower income groups who throng the hospital form across the state for treatment.  The RIMS lab offers tests at subsidised rates of Rs 10 to Rs 90 while at private clinics the same tests costs between Rs 100 to Rs 900.  Deepak Sharma, a daily wager, said, \"My wife is admitted at the medicine ward with jaundice and her treatment is pending as her blood test reports are still not in. I cannot afford the private clinics.\" Manoj Yadav, a daily wager from Latehar, said he had to pay Rs 300 for blood urea test for his son. RIMS charges Rs 10 for the same test.  This is the third time the RIMS laboratory is facing such a crisis. In March and June this year, it had run out of test chemicals.  \"On any given day we take and test almost 150 samples.

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, June 19: Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal today visited Kamakhya temple and took stock of the preparations for the four-day Ambubachi mela that will begin on Wednesday. After paying obeisance to the goddess, the chief minister, along with the temple authorities and government officials, reviewed the preparations for the mela. Sonowal was briefed about the arrangements for successful conduct of the festival, which is considered the biggest religious congregations of eastern India. The chief minister assured the organisers that all possible help would be extended from the government. During the mela, the temple remains closed as the mother goddess is believed to undergo her menstrual cycle. The temple will be closed from 7.26am on Wednesday till 7am on Sunday. Sadhus and devotees from all over the country and abroad have already started arriving at the temple atop the Nilachal hills with the district administration making elaborate arrangements to ensure the mela passes off as planned. Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu, who accompanied Sonowal during his visit to the temple, said the chief minister personally checked the arrangements and expressed satisfaction. Sonowal asked the administration to ensure that none of the visitors, especially women and children, face any difficulty. Besides directing the officials to ensure supply of basic requirements like food, drinking water, lodging and healthcare facilities, Sonowal also instructed them to keep the temple premises and its surroundings clean. \"The chief minister said maximum emphasis must be put on cleanliness and sanitation and adequate number of volunteers shall be engaged,\" Angamuthu said. Necessary arrangements have been made for uninterrupted power supply during the mela.\"No private vehicle will be allowed from the foothill to the temple. A total of 100 buses will be pressed into service to ferry pilgrims from the foothill to the temple free of cost. For the VVIPs, shuttle cars will be made available at the foothill,\" the deputy commissioner added. He said last year, around 15 lakh pilgrims had visited the temple during the mela and this year they are expecting around 25 lakh visitors. Altogether 35 Assam Civil Service officers will be entrusted with the task of overseeing the smooth conduct of the mela. These officers were briefed about their duties by Kamrup (metro) additional deputy commissioner Mukta Nath Saikia at a meeting held at the circuit house here today. The officials were asked to coordinate with the Guwahati Municipal Corporation and public health engineering department to maintain cleanliness on the temple premises. Special arrangements of food and lodging for devotes are being made with the help of various social organisations. CCTV cameras have been installed at the temple and various security agencies will coordinate to ensure foolproof security at the temple during the festival. Sonowal asked the officials to keep a helicopter on standby for emergency. He also visited the camps set up for devotees at Sonaram School playground at Bharalumukh. Chief secretary V.K.

On day one of a marathon\u00a0eight-week campaign, Greens leader Richard Di Natale\u00a0has hightailed it to the inner-Sydney seat of Grayndler, helping his firefighter\u00a0candidate Jim Casey take on Labor's Anthony Albanese.  It sets the scene for a tough slog between the two left-of-centre\u00a0parties, as they fight it out for the hearts and minds of progressive voters in urban seats.  Mr Albanese, who holds Grayndler on a comfortable margin but has been disadvantaged by a redistribution,\u00a0wasted no time in telling the Greens to direct their efforts\u00a0elsewhere.  \"It says a lot about Richard Di Natale\u00a0that his priority today \u2026 is removing me from the federal Parliament. If you\u00a0think the Parliament\u00a0will be\u00a0a more progressive place without me in it ...\u00a0then by all means that's his priority.\"  The comments assert Labor's long-standing position that the Greens should seek to reduce conservatives' presence in Parliament by targeting Coalition-held seats.  At last year's NSW state election, the Greens took the north coast seat of Ballina off the Nationals. They stole the Melbourne seat of Prahran from the Liberals at the 2014 Victorian state election.  Meanwhile, the Greens argue they are simply pursuing their most winnable seats, as all parties are wont to do.  Mr Di Natale recently told Fairfax Media he believes the Greens can win eight lower house seats within a decade, including some Coalition-held seats in Melbourne, New South Wales and Perth.  \"We remind them [Labor]\u00a0that they once had a conscience,\" he said of his critics in the ALP.  Mr Di Natale was also on Sydney radio on Monday morning, railing against the two major parties as \"the Coles and Woolies of politics\" and accusing both of neglecting climate change and the environment.  He\u00a0said Mr Albanese was \"a decent person\" but noted he voted in favour of cuts to the Renewable Energy Target and offshore processing of asylum seekers. Labor was \"locking up young kids\" and \"failing to show the courage against this cruel government\", Mr Di Natale said.  Labor has been particularly sore over a supposed preference\u00a0arrangement between the Greens and the Liberal Party in Victoria, in which Liberals would preference the Greens in seats the Greens are targeting, in return for the Greens running open tickets (rather than preference Labor) in some marginal suburban\u00a0seats.  Mr Albanese\u00a0said that would increase the likelihood of Mr Turnbull remaining Prime Minister and predicted a \"backlash\" from progressive voters.  The Greens currently have one lower house MP\u00a0- Adam Bandt in the seat of Melbourne\u00a0- and are likely to put considerable resources into other Melbourne\u00a0electorates\u00a0such as\u00a0Batman, Wills, Melbourne Ports\u00a0and Higgins.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 09 May 2016 00:15:18 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH652zDqur0XqbxsPl", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "BJP"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarba Siksha Abhiyan"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Himanta Biswa Sarma "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Congress "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarma "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "BJP "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarma "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarma "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarma "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "TET "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "TET"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Krishna Kanta Handiqui State Open University"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarma "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Class IX "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 19"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "A few days ago"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2014 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the same day"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2015"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "a few years ago"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Kamakhya "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Guwahati "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Assam "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Sarma "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Guwahati "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Assam "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sarbananda Sonowal "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ambubachi Mela"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Tarun Gogoi"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sarat Borkataky "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Himanta Biswa "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "UB Photos "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Dinesh Baishya"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Dinesh Baruah"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ramesh Pathak"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Kabita Bhuyan "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "N.M.

(PTI) Guwahati, June 19: The BJP-led government in Assam has regularised posts of 7,234 teachers who had been working on contract under Sarba Siksha Abhiyan. The teachers will now become government employees and enjoy all benefits of a government job. This is the second significant decision taken by the new government in the education sector. A few days ago, it had made admission free for all students from below poverty line families in government educational institutions. The state government had published an advertisement for the teacher posts (in 10 districts) in 2014 when Himanta Biswa Sarma was the education minister. Before completing the appointment process, he left the Congress because of differences with then chief minister Tarun Gogoi. When Sarat Borkataky became education minister, a list of selected candidates was prepared. But the appointment process got stuck in legal tangles. \"Our government has sorted out those legal problems. Now the appointment of these teachers has become possible,\" said Sarma while addressing the media here today. The BJP government has given the education portfolio back to Sarma along with a few others like finance and health. To bring transparency in the appointment process, all appointment letters will be made available on government websites from the morning of July 27. A selected candidate can download the appointment letter and join the school assigned to him/her on the same day. \"There will be one appointment letter against each district. It will carry the names of all candidates selected for the district,\" Sarma said. Education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in Guwahati on Sunday. Picture by UB Photos He said the candidates' schools have been selected through a \"computerised random lottery system\". Six academicians - Indra Kumar Bhattacharya, Dinesh Baishya, Dinesh Baruah, Ramesh Pathak, Kabita Bhuyan and N.M. Hussain - were appointed neutral observers for the process. Around 38,000 TET-qualified teachers are working under SSA in Assam on contract. Sarma had said in the first cabinet meeting that the state government would take a decision on phase-wise regularising of jobs. Sarma said 30,000 teacher posts are lying vacant in the state. \"We can fill up those posts immediately if we get eligible candidates. Passing TET is not the only qualification. After 2015, to become a teacher a candidate must also have a BEd or diploma of education (DEd) degree to become a teacher, besides clearing TET,\" he said. The state has witnessed several protests by those who had passed the test but had not got jobs. When the Assam government had appointed TET-qualified candidates a few years ago, most of them did not have BEd or DEd degrees. With permission from the Centre, it appointed them and made an arrangement so they can acquire those degrees through distance learning from Krishna Kanta Handiqui State Open University. \"BEd and DEd degrees through distance-learning mode are acceptable only for serving teachers but not for others,\" Sarma said. He said he has formed a committee to review the transfer of a section of TET-qualified teachers after their appointment. The step has been taken following complaints that many teachers took transfers as they were unwilling to serve in remote areas. Sarma said the admission of differently-abled students will be free in government educational institutions from Class IX to university level, including professional courses like medical and engineering, from this academic session. He said it will be applicable irrespective of the financial conditions of their families.", "events": [], "date_published": "2016-06-20T18:02:24.521Z"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH658kDqur0XqbxsPr", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "The Madhya Pradesh "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "MK Ranjitsinh"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Belinda Wright "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Supreme Court"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CM"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CM "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NWDA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NWDA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Phase II "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Panna "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Tuesday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Tuesday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "August 11 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Tuesday"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Panna "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Chhatarpur "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Tikamgarh "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Jhansi "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Hamirpur "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "UP.

With this, the project which would impact the Panna tiger reserve, has cleared the first stage of wildlife approval and would now be put up before the national board for wildlife and finally the Supreme Court, whose consent is a must before it can be executed.  So adamant was the CM to approve the project, he did not accept a dissent note being placed among the minutes of the meeting by one of the non-official members.  Tuesday's meeting of the board had been called to specifically discuss the approval to the project as the board during its previous meeting on August 11 had deferred a decision on it after members questioned the report on the project submitted by the national water development agency (NWDA)- the user agency in the project.  In the previous meeting, the CM, who is the chairman of the board had assured members that their objections would be taken into account but on Tuesday, the CM aggressively pushed the project through.  During the meeting, the NWDA sought clearance of the board for using 90 sq kms of tiger habitat including 41.41 sq kms from Panna tiger reserve, 16.62 sq kms non forest area from the reserve, 11.7 sq kms non forest area from buffer area and 20.80 sq kms forests from buffer area are sought for construction of a dam, 1.5 kms in length and 55 metres in height is proposed on the Ken river, a colony for the staff and submergence due to the dam. Earlier, a presentation was held by the NWDA for members of the board.  During the meeting, wildlife expert MK Ranjitsinh said that the project would be approved is a foregone conclusion. He circulated a 3 page letter written by him and wildlife protection society of India (WPSI) chairperson Belinda Wright raising issues with the project. In the letter, it was said that many facts pertaining to the project have been hidden from the board. If the CM decides to go ahead with the project, the letter be placed with the minutes of the meeting as a dissenting note. The CM did not agree to this but MK Ranjitsinh distributed the letter to all members.  A hydrological survey of water availability in Ken river be conducted by a reputed organization and information about Phase II of the project be divulged was also demanded in the letter.  Chief wildlife warden Ravi Shrivastava suggested that as part of the mitigation measures, the state government would transfer 80 sq kms of forests from the buffer area of the Panna tiger reserve to its core. Villages located in this area would also be shifted outside.  \u201cNon official members of the board voiced their concerns about the impact of the project on wildlife,\u201d said senior journalist Abhilash Khandekar who is a member of the board.

They were irate that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was refusing to ban \"Help Wanted Male\" and \"Help Wanted Female\" job advertising.  Typical were ads seeking a \"well-groomed gal\" for a job as a receptionist.  Flash forward to today: Women comprise close to 50 percent of enrollment in U.S. medical schools and law schools. One-third of federal judges are women, compared to just a handful in the 1960s. The U.S military is opening all combat jobs to women.  At NOW and elsewhere in the diverse ranks of the feminist movement, there's deep pride in these changes, but also a consensus that the 50th anniversary \u2014 to be celebrated June 23 \u2014 is not an occasion to declare victory.  \"The battle goes on,\" said Eleanor Smeal, a former president of NOW who heads the Feminist Majority Foundation. \"So many of the things we fought for have been achieved, but we still do not have full equality.\"  Among the issues viewed as unfinished business: a wage gap that favors men over women, the persistent scourge of sexual assault and domestic violence, and the push in many states to reduce access to legal abortion.  Once virtually alone as a national, multi-issue feminist group, NOW shares the activist stage today with a multitude of other players \u2014 ranging from youthful online organizers to groups focused on specific issues such as abortion rights, campus rape and workplace equity. NOW's membership and revenues are down from its peak years, and some younger feminists wonder if it is losing some relevance.  It was different back in 1966. NOW's founding was a pivotal moment in the rebuilding of a vibrant U.S. feminist movement after a period of relative dormancy in the 1940s and '50s.  \"The momentum of the feminist movement that won suffrage and expanded women's rights in the early 20th century had waned,\" says NOW in its own history. \"A negative media blitz proclaimed the death of feminism and celebrated the happy, suburban housewife.\"", "events": [], "date_published": "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 00:14:00 +0800"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65_HDqur0XqbxsPu", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "The Department of State Services "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Indigenous People of Biafra "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "IPOB"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "DSS "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Labaran "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Nzelu "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Nzelu "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "tomorrow"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "September 26 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "yesterday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 19 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "yesterday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "yesterday "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Labaran "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mouma"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kanu\u2019s "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Muoma "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Anambra "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nnamdi Kanu"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Labaran "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Chuks Muoma "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Muoma "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Muoma "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "John Tsoho "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Muoma "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Amobi Nzelu "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Benjamin Nwabugwu "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nzelu "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nzelu"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nwabugwu "}], "url": "http://businessdayonline.com/2016/06/dss-accuses-nnamdi-kanu-of-trying-to-stall-trial/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "DSS accuses Nnamdi Kanu of trying to stall trial", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:35.565Z", "times": [{"code": "TIME", "value": "this morning "}], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "first "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "29"}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}], "article": "AVWicg38Ai2xnyAOXn7C", "content": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has accused the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, of attempts to stall the commencement of his trial.

A huge cache of arms and ammunition were recovered from the rebels who were on their way to an Ulfa (I) camp in Myanmar, for \"advanced training\". The arrest comes two days after an Ulfa (I) cadre was arrested in Dibrugarh district along with explosive materials and gadgets to assemble a bomb. The rebel was on a \"mission\" to carry out blasts outside the BJP office in Dibrugarh town and near Sadar police station under the instruction of senior outfit leader Arunodoy Dohotia. Dibrugarh superintendent of police Bir Bikram Gogoi told The Telegraph today over phone that on the basis of intelligence inputs, a joint team of police, CRPF and the army around 11.30pm raided a hideout inside a jungle at Chetiapathar village under Chabua police station in the district, and arrested the four militants. Gogoi said three 9mm pistols along with 40 live ammunition, six magazines and two Chinese-made wireless sets were recovered from them. The superintendent of police said during interrogation they said that they were coming from a joint camp of GNLA and Ulfa (I) at West Garo Hills jungles in Meghalaya a few days back on the instruction of senior Ulfa-I leader Drishti Rajkhowa. The group was on their way to an Ulfa (I) camp, named Arakan, in Myanmar for advanced training and had reached Dibrugarh district on Friday. Gogoi said the group was waiting for a \"guide\" who was supposed to take them to Myanmar via Arunachal Pradesh from adjoining Tinsukia district. Deputy inspector-general of police (eastern range) Bishnu Prasad Rabha said Ulfa (I) and GNLA are known to be have close ties with each other and were operating along the Assam-Meghalaya border in Goalpara district. Rabha said the two outfits along with Bodo outfits used to have links with NSCN factions (outfits from Nagaland), particularly the NSCN (K), which operates in several areas along the India-Myanmar border. He said the NSCN-K is known to have been providing training, logistical support and arms to several outfits of the Northeast in exchange for payment. Police sources said with Dibrugarh now being chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal's home district, there was high possibility of Ulfa (I) trying to carry out \"subversive acts \" to draw the attention of the government.", "events": [], "date_published": "2016-06-20T18:02:36.325Z"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH66ApDqur0XqbxsPx", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "State "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "a week "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "last weekend"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Oaxaca"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Nochixtlan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Oaxaca City"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "\u2019s CNTE "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Oaxaca"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico\u2019s "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ruben Nunez"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Nunez "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Enrique Galindo"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Gabino Cue "}], "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/euronews/en/home/~3/LN8Rv6Kw15g/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "At least six die and scores are injured in Mexico teacher protests", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:37.423Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "At least six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "100 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "hundreds "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "80 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "LAW", "value": "Section 22 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "Only two"}], "article": "AVWicg4pAi2xnyAOXn7K", "content": "At least six people have been killed and 100 injured in southern Mexico during clashes between members of a teachers\u2019 trade union and police.

The protest on Sunday near the town of Nochixtlan, 80 kilometres northwest of Oaxaca City, has been going on for a week now.  Roads have been blocked with burning tyres.

The company, which now claims 55.5% share in the instant noodles market, however, says financially it could take a few more quarters to fully overcome the 500 crore hit it took because of the ban on Maggi last year.  \u201cWe have weathered the storm, although we still have two cases pending in the court. Now it is the time to ride the wave,\u201d Nestle India Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told PTI.  For this Nestle India is focusing on rejuvenation of existing brands, adding new products and entering into new categories targeting a wide range of consumer segment from babies, to youth to women and adults in urban markets.  Elaborating on the company\u2019s new product launch programme, Narayanan said: \u201cThere are about 20-25 product launches, some of them have happened, some are happening and some will happen in four to six weeks time. This is probably the single largest window of new product launches in a long time.\u201d  The new products include seven variants of Maggi noodles, Greek yogurt brand \u2018Grekyo\u2019 and protein growth brand \u2018Pro-Gro\u2019 in dairy segment, besides multiple products in chocolate and confectionery, as also new offerings in coffee and tea.  \u201cWe are trying to look at product concepts that are differentiators. The launches are multi-targeted in terms of consumer base that we are looking at,\u201d he said.  Stating that the company has also shortened the time for launching new products to 4-6 months from 12-15 months earlier to keep pace with the changing dynamics in the market, Narayanan said: \u201cToday the urban Indian consumers are changing quite rapidly, their tastes are changing.\u201d  When asked about competition from Baba Ramdev\u2019s Patanjali Ayurved, Narayanan said: \u201cThat is the kind of competition we would positively call disruptive competition. They come and redefine the rules of the game...I have said that script for the future will be written by redefining the rules of the past.\u201d  Asked whether Maggi has been able to reach the pre-ban levels, he said, \u201cToday we have 55.5% market share compared to 77% before withdrawal. Our hope and effort is to get back to where we were.\u201d  The instant noodles market in India is estimated to be 2,000 crore with ITC\u2019s Yippee, Nepal-based Chaudhary group\u2019s Wai Wai and Patanjali Noodles among major players besides Maggi.  Narayanan declined to share an exact timeline when Nestle India will fully overcome the financial hit due to Maggi ban.  \u201cThat impact of 500 crore was quite significant in our books.

But if the poll result goes the other way, the junta will face new challenges and an uphill battle.As such, it is perfectly understandable that the NCPO wants the referendum to go smoothly and render a result that offers the credibility it sorely needs. However, if that process includes the convenient burial of all opposition voices, the end result will be neither impressive nor an endorsement of junta rule.The recent suppression of referendum-monitoring stations set up by red shirts is a case in point. The NCPO has successfully thwarted their launch, but this does not mean that it has secured a victory. If anything, the opposite is the case.Because the claimed purpose of the centres was to monitor for fraud, red-shirt leaders like Jatuporn Prompan and Nattawut Saikuar can now ask, \"If you're not planning to cheat, then what are you afraid of?\"They also have an excuse to seek assistance from international agencies for scrutiny of the vote, adding pressure to an NCPO already facing strong criticism over its restrictions against campaigning and its wider ban on political activities. Of particular concern is vague wording in the referendum law that seems aimed at instilling an atmosphere of fear and silence rather than open debate.The situation is exacerbated by contradicting statements made almost daily by the authorities. We were assured that wearing a T-shirt with a \"vote no\" slogan was not illegal, only to be told a day or two later that it is an offence. Prayut announced that red shirts could set up referendum monitoring centres, then the next day said something entirely different.Amid all the restrictions and confusion, concern is growing over whether the referendum can be free and fair.The atmosphere is an unhealthy one not just for the public, but also for the regime that has imposed it. While the public is denied the information necessary to making informed decisions at the polling booth, the referendum result cannot be considered an endorsement of the current regime. If the draft charter passes under these undemocratic conditions, the junta's claim to be safeguarding the passage back to democracy will ring more hollow than ever.chanwanpen92@gmail.com", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 18:00:00 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH647jDqur0XqbxsOW", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Pakistan People's Party "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "6,700-square"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Sindh assembly"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Sindh Growers' Board"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Development Department "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Keti Bunder "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Strengthening Participatory Organization"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Keti Bunder "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Sindh Development Review "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Sindh Development Review "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Keti Bunder "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Pakistan Meteorological Department"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "the early 20th century"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2025"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "daily "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Ten years ago"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2025"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the past 30 years"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1955 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "60 years ago "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2006"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the past two decades"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2010 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the past 20 years"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "at least a couple of months "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2012 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the previous decade"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "LOC", "value": "the Arabian Sea "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Indus River "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Indus Delta "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Thatta "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Keti Bunder"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Thatta"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Keti Bunder"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Keti Bunder "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Saleem"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Indus River "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Thatta "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Badin"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Thatta "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Arabian Sea "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kotri "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Indus Delta "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Indus River "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "the International Union "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Indus Delta "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Arabian Sea "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Humera Alwani "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mohammad Saleem"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Alwani"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Abdul Majeed Nizamani"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Zahid Jalbani"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jalbani "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jalbani "}], "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2014/04/02/Villagers-in-Pakistan-face-threat-from-rising-seawater/31374023587237/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Villagers in Pakistan face threat from rising seawater", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:24.222Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "190 miles "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "1.1 million"}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "2 feet "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "Around 80 acres "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "seven "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "about 1.2 million "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "1,875 square miles"}, {"code": "WORK_OF_ART", "value": "The Sindh Development Review "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "66 feet "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "four "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "5,500 feet "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "34 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "42 "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "49 trillion gallons "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "235 billion gallons "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "8.8 trillion gallons"}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "40 miles "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "40 miles "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "about 5,300 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "about one-tenth "}], "article": "AVWicgyiAi2xnyAOXn6S", "content": "The intrusion of the Arabian Sea into the mouth of the Indus River on Pakistan's southern coast is eroding land, forcing whole villages to relocate inland, and threatening fishing livelihoods, residents and environmental experts say.  As sea levels rise globally, low-lying coastal areas become vulnerable to the incoming saltwater.  The sea\u2019s intrusion into the once-thriving Indus Delta in the coastal Thatta district occurs mainly because the Indus River does not carry enough water below the Kotri Barrage, a major dam 190 miles north of the coast, to hold back the saltwater from the river and its network of creeks and mudflats. The seawater intrusion turns fields and underground drinking water saline, makes land waterlogged and reduces fish catch.  In the early 20th century, the area was famous for production and export of red rice and fish. For centuries earlier, it was a center of trade and scholarship, partly due to the old port at the seafront town of Keti Bunder. Now the survival of this part of the dying delta region is threatened.  Local lawmaker Humera Alwani of the opposition Pakistan People's Party says that at the current rate of erosion, the 6,700-square-mile district of Thatta, with its population of 1.1 million, could be gone by 2025.  The effects and threats of the inflow and erosion are pronounced in Keti Bunder.  Mohammad Saleem, a lifelong Keti Bunder resident, watches daily as the sea erodes the earthen dike, near his wooden house.  Ten years ago, a few miles separated his house from the muddy waterline. Now, he points to a spot seemingly far out to sea where his and his neighbors\u2019 homes used to be before encroaching seawater forced them out.  \"We had to move here and set up our village all over again because the sea had entered our village over there,\" he said.  Houses are set on posts 2 feet off the ground.  Villagers will have ample time to leave if the sea makes its way to their village again after eating through the dike.  The water flowing near Saleem's home used to be drinkable -- from the Indus River -- but now it is all saline. He says the shoreline used to be a few miles farther out, meaning that river water used to surround the area until its flow was reduced, allowing seawater in.  The PPP's Alwani has predicted that if the sea level rise and seawater intrusion continue at the current pace, Thatta and a neighboring district, Badin, will be gone by 2025.  \"Around 80 acres of land have been eroded by the sea in Thatta district alone. There used to be seven ports here but all of them were destroyed by the encroaching sea,\" Alwani, a member of the Sindh assembly, told UPI Next.  Over the past 30 years, the Arabian Sea has devoured about 1.2 million acres (1,875 square miles) of land from the coasts of both districts, says Abdul Majeed Nizamani, chairman of the Sindh Growers' Board, which represents farmers, landlords, peasants and others involved in agriculture.  \"The Sindh Development Review 2008-2009,\u201d a provincial Planning and Development Department report, cites a study estimating Keti Bunder mudflat erosion at 66 feet per year with the rate in one of the four major creeks near the town was as high as 5,500 feet per year.  Though no official records exist, 34 of the sub-district's 42 settlements have disappeared under the sea, said Zahid Jalbani, a program manager at Strengthening Participatory Organization, which specializes in development advocacy.  The intrusion accelerated after a dam was built at the town of Kotri in 1955 to divert fresh water for irrigation and flood control, Jalbani said.  \"The flow of freshwater in the Indus Delta is too low to push the seawater back and sustain the areas in and around it,\" he told UPI Next.  \"As a result, the seawater creeps up the river channels, affecting the whole ecosystem of the area. The original residents of Keti Bunder were not fishermen but farmers. The region used to be famous around the world for the production of red rice.\"  Since water reserves have been destroyed by salinity and the land is too barren to grow anything, more than 90 percent of the population rely on fishing as their main source of income, Jalbani said.  \"But sea intrusion and changing weather patterns have also badly damaged the fish catch,\" he said.  The Sindh Development Review states freshwater discharge from the Indus River into the delta has plunged from 49 trillion gallons 60 years ago to 235 billion gallons in 2006.  Although the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, an international environmental organization, has calculated the required flow at the delta to be 8.8 trillion gallons, the flow has been less than 3.3 trillion gallons for the past two decades.  The only exception was 2010 when the country was ravaged by a massive flood.  The effects of saltwater intrusion can be felt up to 40 miles upstream, the Sindh Development Review report found.  Shakeel Memon, a Keti Bunder activist, said the only source of drinking water is from tankers filled 40 miles inland.  \"We have had no [local source of] drinking water for the past 20 years,\" Memon told UPI Next.  \"Before that, the river channels used to be full for at least a couple of months during monsoon season.\"  A 2012 report by the Pakistan Meteorological Department, \u201cClimate Change in Pakistan Focused on Sindh Province,\u201d states about 5,300 glaciers in northern Pakistan are on a steady retreat, while in coastal areas, especially in the Indus Delta region, temperatures are on a constant climb.  Moreover, it found the sea level rising at about one-tenth of an inch per year.  The report predicted the situation would get much worse.  It said the frequency of droughts and floods in the delta had increased considerably during the previous decade. Increased tidal and storm activity in the Arabian Sea was causing more saltwater intrusion and coastal erosion, hindering agriculture and depleting fish stocks and mangroves.", "events": [], "date_published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2014 17:57:00 -0400"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH64_tDqur0XqbxsOa", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "The Five Star Movement "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "seven years ago "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "these days"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "1860 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2007 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "2009 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "May last year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "67-year-old "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "seat 18 months ago "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Italy "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Italy "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Sicily"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Beppe Grillo"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Beppo Grillo "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Beppe Grillo\u2019s "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Grillo "}], "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/euronews/en/home/~3/BGYNUP10XbE/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "The birth and growth of Italy's Five Star Movement", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:30.056Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "Five "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Italian "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "PERCENT", "value": "25 percent "}, {"code": "PERCENT", "value": "80 percent "}], "article": "AVWicg0mAi2xnyAOXn6o", "content": "The Five Star Movement was launched seven years ago and founded as a protest party by the Italian comedian Beppe Grillo.

The Five Star Movement was born in 2009 \u2013 in the middle of the malaise towards traditional politics when Beppe Grillo\u2019s blog evolved into a place for direct participation where activists were invited to comment on policy guidelines and the selection of candidates.  By drawing on the right and left of politics the measures of party are varied: no longer is the party seen as one of protest. Proposals now include the establishment of a minimum income, a referendum to exit the eurozone, universal income support for the poor, tougher measures on white collar crime and tax evasion. The movement wants to cut taxes for small businesses while free internet for all is another measure.  It made a sensational debut surprising many political watchers in the parliamentary elections of 2013 when it won around 25 percent of the vote.  Refusing to join forces with any party, in May last year the Five Star Movement decided not to support a bill to give gay couples the right to a civil union which 80 percent of activists in the movement had backed.  According to some political commentators the move was to avoid alienating the right and handing a political victory to the government.  The 67-year-old comic took a back seat 18 months ago but still wields huge influence across the party and is seen by some as the supreme judge.

It is why only 11,000 of the 30,000 ended up benefiting from the programme. This is what has prompted the boys back into the creeks.\u201d  According to Ekiyor, the pathway to finding amicable solution to the impasse is for those who initiated and managed the amnesty be invited back to chart a fresh course and for those who abused the process to be brought to book.  \u201cThose who handled the amnesty can be consulted, they are still alive. The programme need to be expended. Government has to pay serious attentions to development issues in the region. How many ports are working in the Niger Delta?

In recent days, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed 15-day emergency food rations to more than 1,400 newly displaced people finding refuge in Diffa town. This week, food assistance is on its way for thousands more newly displaced people at sites between Diffa and Bosso towns, with 157 metric tonnes on the move.  \u201cTens of thousands of people have been uprooted this past week following what was the deadliest attack since April 2015,\u201d said Belkacem Machane, WFP Niger Deputy Country Director. \u201cMore than half of them are women and children. These are people who have already been displaced several times due to the violence spilling across the border with Nigeria. They have now reached the end of their rope.\u201d  \u201cMany have walked from 10 to 40 kilometres. They are arriving in a state of shock, and urgently need food, shelter, water \u2013 assistance with their most basic needs,\u201d added Machane.  As the situation of the newly displaced people becomes clearer, WFP plans to continue reaching those most in need in Diffa town and at displaced people\u2019s sites at Ngagam, Kintchandi and Garim Wazam.  More than 240,000 people have been displaced in Diffa region. A total of 450,000 people in the region \u2013 nearly 70 percent of the population \u2013 face hunger. With the onset of the lean season, WFP is concerned that hunger can only deepen.  To date, WFP provided food and nutrition assistance to some 136,000 refugees, displaced people and vulnerable host communities.  Where markets are functioning and food is available, WFP provides cash assistance so that people can buy the food that they need for their families, and also support the local economy.

The IPFT, which had given the call for a separate state shortly after the formation of Telangana out of undivided Andhra Pradesh, has organised a series of movements over the past few years. But the Left Front has consistently opposed its demand. \"Since our non-violent and peaceful movement has not yielded any result so far, we will resort to a road blockade to press for our demand,\" said IPFT president Narendra Debbarma. The blockade will start from 7am and will continue till 5 in the evening. Debbarma described the CPM's stand regarding the blockade as \"provocative\". \"We have already announced that our programme will be peaceful but the way the CPM has been campaigning against our event, it will be responsible if any untoward incident happens on that day,\" said Debbarma. In order to resist the highway blockade, the CPM has also been carrying out demonstrations, rallies and meetings, describing the IPFT's demand for a separate state as \"divisive\". A massive procession along with a meeting was organised yesterday in Agartala town. Addressing the programme, CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar said the IPFT's demand for \"division of Tripura\" in the name of creation of a separate state was not acceptable to the people and the attempt would be resisted at all costs. \"Considering the socio-economic and political interests of tribal people, the ADC was formed covering 68.10 per cent of the state's total geographical area and we had fought to press for the demand. But this new demand is divisive and unnecessary,\" said Dhar. Addressing a huge gathering at Shakuntala Chowmuhuni, Dhar said the ADC was being empowered by the state government in a phased manner as an instrument of development of tribal community and their political autonomy. \"In a small state like Tripura with a total geographical area of 10,491.69 square km, a second state cannot simply be created. Even the constitutional requirements to create a full-fledged state cannot be fulfilled and it is not even geographically viable. Therefore, the IPFT is misleading the tribal people in the name of separate state to retain its fast-eroding political relevance,\" said Dhar.

Provincial minister for local bodies, Jam Khan Shoro, and Home Minister Suhail Anwar Siyal, both relatively recent appointments, are also likely to be relieved of their posts, it was said.

According to a state government rule, educational institutions will have to accommodate the 17 per cent OBC quota, introduced in 2013, without affecting the general category seats. However, according to a guideline of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), which regulates teacher-training courses across the country, a BEd college must increase facilities if the number of students in a class exceeds 50. If the number of seats is increased by even one, the number of teachers and the infrastructure must be doubled. Officials in BEd and MEd colleges across the state, where the admission process began earlier this month, said they had been admitting OBC students in the general category. \"In a class of 50 BEd students, if 28 per cent are reserved for SCs and STs, it leaves 36 seats for general category applicants. But if the state government rule on OBC quota is to be followed, we have to increase the number of seats as the general category cannot be compromised with,\" an education department official said. Increasing the seats for BEd and MEd courses has proved difficult for the colleges because of the NCTE guideline, which makes it mandatory to double the number of teachers and infrastructure. According to NCTE rules, for every 50 BEd or MEd students in a class, there has to be at least eight full-time teachers, a minimum of 3,000sqm built-up area and at least one laboratory and one library. If the student intake is increased even by one, the institution will have to recruit 16 full-time teachers, ensure 6,000sqm of built-up area and provide at least two laboratories and two libraries. In Bengal, BEd and MEd courses are offered by 242 colleges and nine universities, respectively. Admissions, which began early this month, are likely to continue till mid-July. Most of these colleges are affiliated to the West Bengal University Of Teachers' Training, Education Planning and Administration. The remaining are under a clutch of varsities, including Burdwan University, North Bengal University, Vidyasagar University and Sidho Kanho Birsa University. \"Although the admission process started at the beginning of this month, not a single student has been taken in under the OBC quota so far,\" said a senior official of the newly set up West Bengal University Of Teachers' Training, Education Planning and Administration. Education minister Partha Chatterjee said the government remained committed to the OBC quota, announced by Mamata Banerjee. \"I don't know anything like this.... We remain committed to the quota for OBC students. I will ask the higher education secretary why OBC students are not being allowed to seek admission through the 17 per cent quota earmarked for them,\" he said. While it is true that the admission process is far from being over, sources in the BEd and MEd institutions said they had no plan of admitting students under the OBC quota this year. An official said meeting the NCTE requirement to admit more than 50 students in a class would take time. \"Till then, let's see what we can do,\" the official said. In 2013, the government introduced the West Bengal State Higher Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, making it mandatory for every university and undergraduate college to reserve 17 per cent seats for OBC students. The OBC quota is split into two categories - A (10 per cent) and B (7 per cent). Category A includes the more backward among the OBCs and Category B includes around 80 backward classes.

The 23rd station of the Metro Bus \u2014 Parade Ground \u2014 located at Jinnah Avenue, was partially destroyed nearly three months ago by supporters of Mumtaz Qadri. The government says that as per the understanding with the leaders, they were not supposed to come to Islamabad and peacefully disperse after observing Qadri\u2019s \u2018chehlum\u2019 at Liaquat Bagh.  The Metro Bus project, according to media reports, cost at least Rs45 billion. But the sad part of the matter is that back-up equipment and related material was not kept to meet any emergency situation. This is a serious laps, which continues to hit the commuters, particularly students, doctors and those who work in private or government offices, in the vicinity of the unfortunate bus station.  Power generators and other installations were destroyed or partially by the ransackers. Many fixed chairs were also uprooted. No Metro Bus stops at this station to drop or lift commuters for the last almost three months. Hence, they have to walk in scorching heat for 15-25 minutes to reach the next station i.e. Shaheed-e-Millat stop.  And, if by mistake, one forgets to step down at this stop, he has no other option than to descend on the last station i.e. Pak Secretariat and then again board another bus to go closer to his destination. As walk from here is not an option at all.  \u201cYes, we could have resumed operations within a week or so at this station, if we have had spare equipment,\u201d conceded a Punjab Metro Bus Authority official, who did not wish to be identified in this piece.  He explained that equipment was being imported and it would take some more days before it reaches and then, its installation would also take some days if not weeks.  It is quite interesting to note that this scribe has visited several stations in the twin cities and found that whenever, chair is damaged, or glass is broken or water cooler stops working, it is never repaired. So much so, images of Quaid-e-Azam and other key figures of the Pakistan Movement, installed at some of the stations, present a sorry look after being partially damaged.  The first major commuting project for the locals was completed in little more than a year. But now the repair of just one bus station is taking so much time.  \u201cThe government must hold accountable those, who executed this project but failed to realise that there is a need for some back-up stuff to keep the entire commuting network operational without much wastage of time,\u201d asserted a commuter, who stepped in to record his disgust at the sorry state of affairs at Parade Ground bus station.  The Metro Bus employees are also idle here and wonder exactly when the station will be operational again.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH654ADqur0XqbxsPn", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "UB Photos Guwahati"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Class XII "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Sarma"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "XII "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Cotton College "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Gauhati Commerce College "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 19"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 16 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "this year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "This year "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Guwahati "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Assam "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Sonowal "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Raj Bhavan "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "P.B.

Acharya \u00a0at Raj Bhavan in Guwahati on Sunday. Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, June 19: Assam governor P.B. Acharya today asked chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to publish a white paper on budget allocation during past three years to the education sector and compare results of government schools with private schools. In a letter to Sonowal Acharya after seeing the poor performance of government schools in Class X and Class XII board examinations compared to their private counterparts, the governor made a few observations. He had felicitated this year's rank holders in these two examinations on June 16 and 17 at Raj Bhavan. \"The governor's observations were that rank holders are almost all from private schools, no government school has achieved excellence, the achievers are only from a few districts and that there is hardly any tribal student achiever,\" said a statement released from Raj Bhavan today. Acharya wrote to Sonowal that these observations should be a major cause of concern for the state government and need to be addressed promptly. He also said the proposed action to improve quality of educational atmosphere in the government schools should be included in their corrective steps for the future. Acharya said there was an urgent necessity to seriously overhaul the system. Poor performance of government schools has been a cause of concern to the state government. The results of the government schools are poor despite the fact that the teachers of these schools get higher salaries and many of these schools have better infrastructure than their private counterparts. Education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma reminds the teachers about it whenever he meets them together. \"I want the government school teachers to be asked by their family members about poor performance in their schools. I also want to know the answer from the teachers themselves. I have talked to them about this so many times,\" said Sarma, when asked by a reporter recently. While the performance of government schools in the Class X board examinations are noticeably poor compared to private institutions, a significant number of rank holders in the Class XII board examinations this year were from government schools. This year six students from Cotton College and nine students from Gauhati Commerce College were among rank holders in the Class XII examinations.", "events": [], "date_published": "2016-06-20T18:02:26.957Z"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH654qDqur0XqbxsPo", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Civil Hospital "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "WAPDA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Hyderabad\u2019s Electric Supply Company\u2019s "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Tufail Ahmed Shaikh"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Friday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "five days"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Hyderabad "}, {"code": "FAC", "value": "Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Institute "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Hyderabad"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mustafa Raza Shaikh "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Benazir Qadri-both "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mustafa"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mustafa "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mustafa\u2019s "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Meanwhil Benazir"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "\u2019s "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Khadim Hussain"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mustafa "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Benazir "}], "url": "http://www.newspakistan.pk/2016/06/20/couple-found-dead-car-apparent-suicide/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "Couple found dead in car in an apparent suicide", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:27.150Z", "times": [{"code": "TIME", "value": "evening"}], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Hussainabad "}], "article": "AVWicgzuAi2xnyAOXn6c", "content": "A young man and woman were found dead in a car parked in a garage in Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) colony on Friday evening.

After being discovered, the couple\u2019s bodies were taken to Civil Hospital by residents of the WAPDA colony. The investigating officers wanted to perform autopsy on both the bodies, but their parents took away the bodies without allowing the post-mortem to be carried out.  Despite the refusal for an autopsy, the Hussainabad police brought Mustafa\u2019s body to the hospital in order to conduct a post-mortem. Mustafa was the son of Hyderabad\u2019s Electric Supply Company\u2019s safety director, Tufail Ahmed Shaikh. Mustafa\u2019s family eventually agreed to provide the body for post-mortem in order to find out answers related to his mysterious death.  Meanwhil Benazir\u2019s family did not like the possibility of a post-mortem and her father, Khadim Hussain, told police that his daughter committed suicide. Apparently Mustafa and Benazir wanted to get married but their families did not allow it, due to which they killed themselves.

"AVWicg2mAi2xnyAOXn62", "content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia is holding the crew of a Chinese fishing boat it says was fishing illegally last week in the South China Sea, an official confirmed on Monday. It was the third maritime skirmish \u2014 all involving warning shots \u2014 between the two countries in the past three months.  The latest episode occurred on Friday when Indonesian warships challenged a group of Chinese fishing boats operating within Indonesia\u2019s 200-mile exclusive economic zone off the Natuna Islands, northwest of Borneo, said Atmadji Sumarkidjo, a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs.  The Indonesian Navy fired warning shots to get the fishing boats to halt, which the Chinese say injured one sailor, and confiscated one boat and detained its seven-member crew, Mr. Atmadji said. The crew was taken to the Natuna Islands, he said. The injured person was not one of those detained and was treated on the Chinese island of Hainan.  \u201cLike the previous incidents, the Chinese ships were fishing in the area that we claim is part of our E.E.Z.,\u201d Mr. Atmadji said, referring to the exclusive economic zone. \u201cThe navy pursued them, and they tried to run away and did not obey our instructions to stop.\u201d  Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement on the ministry\u2019s website on Sunday contending that the fishing boats were operating in \u201cChina\u2019s traditional fishing grounds\u201d in the South China Sea. The statement said that the boats were \u201charassed and shot by several Indonesian naval vessels.\u201d  China lodged a diplomatic protest to Indonesia after the episode, the statement said. A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry was not immediately available for comment.  In March, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel forcibly recovered a fishing boat that had been confiscated by Indonesia near the Natuna Islands by ramming the boat. The boat\u2019s eight Chinese crew members, already on an Indonesian ship, were detained after being accused of fishing illegally. The Indonesian authorities had fired warning shots at the boat, using small arms to force it to stop.  In May, the Indonesian Navy fired warning shots at a Chinese fishing boat and detained its eight-person crew, also in the region of the Natuna Islands, on suspicion of fishing illegally.  In China, people expressed outrage over the episode and urged the government to do more to stand up to Indonesia.  \u201cYou call yourself a big and strong nation, but how come a small country like Indonesia dares to slap your face?\u201d a user wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter.  Another user posted, \u201cWhere\u2019s the hawkish faction in the military? It\u2019s your turn to make an appearance now.\u201d  The episodes come amid rising tensions in the region, where China has territorial disputes with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam \u2014 four members of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean.  Members of the group have increasingly expressed concern about China\u2019s aggressive posture in the South China Sea, including naval standoffs and land reclamation projects in disputed areas, and the stationing of military personnel and surface-to-air missiles in the Paracel Islands \u2014 which are controlled by China, which claims ownership, but are also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.  An international arbitration body in The Hague is expected to rule in the coming weeks on a case that the Philippines has filed over China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea.  Indonesia is not a claimant in the South China Sea disputes, but China\u2019s contentious nine-dash line, which marks its territorial claims to around 90 percent of the South China Sea, appears to overlap with part of Indonesia\u2019s maritime exclusive economic zone around the Natuna Islands, according to analysts.  Since 1994, Indonesia has sought clarification from China about whether the nine-dash line included the Natuna Islands or Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone around them.  Last November, China publicly recognized Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty over the Natuna Islands but did not address the issue of the exclusive economic zone.  The Chinese statement released on Sunday said that the latest skirmish occurred in an area \u201cwhere China and Indonesia have overlapping claims for maritime rights and interests.\u201d The statement accused Indonesia of violating international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  In the past, the Indonesian government had played down such episodes or kept them under wraps, as China is Indonesia\u2019s largest trading partner. But Jakarta this year has been more aggressive in defending its exclusive economic zone, given that one of the key policies of Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, is to combat illegal fishing and turn the country into a maritime power.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 09:57:47 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH64oFDqur0XqbxsOK", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "the Supreme Appellate Court "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SAC"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Awami Workers Party "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ATC"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Aliabad "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SAC "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ATC "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ATC "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "AWP.

An anti-terrorism court (ATC) had earlier found them guilty of ransacking a police station and damaging government property during political riots at Aliabad in 2011.  The decision comes days before a local by-election he planned to contest, amid an international campaign calling for his freedom. A large number of people who disagree with Baba Jan\u2019s political ideology also believe the allegations made against him are false and politically motivated.  A three-member bench of SAC \u2013 consisting of Chief Justice Rana Muhammad Shamim, Justice Javed Iqbal and Justice Shahbaz Khan \u2013 upheld the ATC verdict by two judges to one, with Justice Shahbaz Khan deciding in favor of the political activists.  \u201cI cannot comment on the decision, but we were not expecting this,\u201d said Advocate Nazir, one of the lawyers pleading Baba Jan\u2019s case.  The ATC had said in its verdict that the prosecution was able to prove that the 12 accused men were \u201cguilty of vandalizing property, attacking public servants, and ransacking arms and ammunitions from the police station\u201d. Each of the convicts were also fined Rs 100,000 by the court.  \u201cWe strongly condemn the decision. It was politically motivated,\u201d said Farzana Bari, civil rights activist and a member of the AWP. \u201cIt is an attempt by his political rivals to move Baba Jan out of their way.\u201d She said it conveyed a stern message to the people of the area, that \u201cthe politics of Baba Jan, who speaks for the rights of locals, is not acceptable in the region\u201d.  Hailing from the Nasirbad town in Hunza valley, Baba Jan is a leading figure of the AWP, which was formed in 2012 following the merger of Labour Party, Workers Party and Awami Party.  On January 2, 2010, a massive landslide killed around 20 people and blocked the flow of Hunza River for almost five months, turning Attabad village into a lake. Baba Jan organized the displaced people to lobby the government for compensation and rehabilitation.  On August 11, 2011 a large number of Attabad victims took to the streets. Police tried to disperse the protesters at Aliabad, where the convoy then chief minister Mehdi Shah was on its way on the highway. When the protesters resisted, police began using teargas. Then, two protesters \u2013 Sherullah Baig and his son Afzal Baig \u2013 were shot dead. The killings led to riots in Hunza valley. In Aliabad, a police station was ransacked and government buildings were looted. Police registered a case against the rioters and arrested around one hundred people. All but 17 of them were released.  According to AWP spokesman Farooq Tariq, \u201cThose who agreed to join PML-N were freed.\u201d  In September 2014, an ATC declared five of them innocent, and sentenced the remaining 12 \u2013 including Baba Jan \u2013 to life imprisonment. A judicial probe was also carried out, but its report was not made public.  After the SAC decision, the local leadership of the AWP called a press conference and vowed to renew their struggle for the release of Baba Jan and 11 other people. The PPP and the PML-N had been blaming each other for the riots, they said, and that was proof that Baba Jan is innocent. On June 12, AWP activists gathered at Nasirabad in solidarity with Baba Jan.  Baba Jan had contested the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly elections from behind the bars in 2015. He was the runner up in the GBLA-6 constituency, which was won by now-governor Mir Ghazanfar Ali, who belongs to the PML-N.  The AWP had announced that Baba Jan would contest the by-polls scheduled on May 28.\u00a0 On April 30, the returning officer rejected his nomination papers on the grounds of his conviction. Four days later, a court accepted an appeal by Baba Jan\u2019s lawyer against the rejection. But days prior to the election, the SAC ordered postponing the by-polls for three weeks. According to local media, the decision was made to \u201cfirst complete the hearing of pending criminal cases against Baba Jan\u201d.  The SAC verdict means Baba Jan will not be able to contest the elections, Advocate Nazir said. \u201cHowever, we have submitted a review petition.\u201d  For political analyst Amir Hussain, that means a missed opportunity \u201cto show the world that we respect dissenting views expressed through the ballot\u201d.  According to veteran journalist Abdul Jabbar Nasir \u2013 who says he strongly disagrees with the politics and the ideology of Baba Jan \u2013 \u201cthe decision was not fair\u201d, especially when the by-polls were approaching.  But he also criticized the AWP for not pleading the case of its workers in a strong way. \u201cThe party supports Baba Jan for political reasons, but it did not even bother to hire some leading legal experts of the country for the case,\u201d he said.  The AWP has announced countrywide protests, calling for the judicial probe of the Aliabad incident to be made public, and a review of Baba Jan and his comrades\u2019 conviction.", "events": [], "date_published": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 03:42:45 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH64-8Dqur0XqbxsOZ", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Social Weather Stations "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "\u201d Presidential Communications Operations Office "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SWS "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "BusinessWorld"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NCR"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NCR"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ABC "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "three months "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 30"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "six-year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "yesterday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "10 or 60 percent of "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "December last year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "yesterday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "March 30 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "April 2 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "December\u2019s "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "December\u2019s +35"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "MANILA"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Philippines "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "+39 "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Luzon "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mindanao"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Luzon "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "+30 "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mindanao "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Visayas "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "+17 "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Aquino "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Aquino"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Malaca\u00f1ang "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Aquino"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Aquino "}], "url": "http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/21/1595077/sws-satisfaction-aquino-administration-drops", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "SWS: Satisfaction with Aquino administration drops", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:29.808Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "four "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Philippine "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "Six "}, {"code": "PERCENT", "value": "26 percent "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "14 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "1,200 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "six "}, {"code": "PRODUCT", "value": "Visayas "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "five "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "six "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "seven "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two"}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "16 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "three "}], "article": "AVWicg0dAi2xnyAOXn6m", "content": "MANILA, Philippines - Public satisfaction with the performance of the Aquino administration dipped by four percentage points but remained \u201cgood,\u201d according to a latest survey conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS) three months before President Aquino\u2019s term ends on June 30.

Both ratings are classified by SWS as good.  The remaining 14 percent of respondents were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, the pollster said.

It has sampling error margins of plus or minus three percentage points for national percentages, and plus or minus six percentage points each for the Metro Manila, Luzon areas outside NCR, the Visayas and Mindanao.

For the first time in three years, the mining industry has an upbeat outlook, with 43 per cent of industry leaders optimistic about the year ahead, compared to just 10 per cent a year ago, according to the Mining Business Outlook Report released by Newport Consulting.  The report draws on interviews with 50 mining leaders and features an interview with mining magnate Ms Rinehart, who warns that the greatest challenge for Australia's mining industry today is \"onerous and expensive\" government regulation.  \"Without significant action to address this issue, we will continue to see the substantial decline in exploration investment,\" Ms Rinehart says in the report.  \"And without this investment to find the next big mineral resource deposits, I fear that we will not see the development of a mega project like Roy Hill for a long time to come.  Newport Consulting managing director David Hand said the report had found an improvement in sentiment in the mining industry.  \"The mining community has its own conviction that commodity prices have found their floor,\" Mr Hand told AAP.  \"They won't go down from here.\"  Despite concerns about poor market conditions, low commodity prices and capital constraints, there has been a distinctly positive shift in sentiment and outlook among the miners.  \"They can begin to see the future,\" Mr Hand said.  \"When you are in a situation of falling prices, which the sector has been in for two or three years, you just don't know where it's going to end so you don't make any decisions or plans.\"  While half of the miners expect commodity prices to stabilise over the next 12 months, companies are looking beyond the current economic situation as they prepare for growth.  More than a quarter of Australian miners reported no change to spending, and despite predictions of further job cuts, around one in ten companies now plan to boost their workforce in the year ahead.  That comes after 80 per cent of miners shed staff last year.  Among the leaders who were not as optimistic about the next 12 months, almost half cited poor market conditions for the lack of confidence.  Meanwhile, the number of companies reducing staff has decreased from 80 to 44 per cent over the past year.  Mr Hand said job losses and mine closures were ongoing but the mood for retrenchments had \"dissipated\".

Marrengula  17 June 2016 \u0096 The global stockpile of the yellow fever vaccine may not be sufficient if simultaneous outbreaks hit the densely populated areas not covered by emergency responses, the United Nations health agency has warned, noting that by mid-June 2016, almost 18 million doses have been distributed in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Uganda this year.  In particular, the Angola outbreak has depleted six million doses twice this year already, a level never seen before. In the past, no more than four million doses have been used to control an outbreak in one country.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), which raised the concern today, the world\u2019s four major vaccine manufacturers have been working around the clock to replenish the stockpile, bringing the global stockpile to 6.2 million doses in early June.  Urban yellow fever can spread rapidly in densely populated cities, causing thousands of deaths and very serious humanitarian consequences. Vaccination is the most important measure for preventing the disease. But production takes a long time \u2013 around 12 months \u2013 and it is difficult to forecast in advance the quantities that will be needed each year to respond to outbreaks.  In 1997, WHO, in partnership with the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), created the International Coordinating Group (ICG) to manage emergency vaccine stockpiles for future outbreaks and coordinate the distribution of vaccines to the affected areas.  Yellow fever was first confirmed on 19 January 2016 in Angola. Nine days later, the Angolan Ministry of Health requested 1.8 million doses from the global stockpile of emergency vaccine supplies, which was approved the same day.  Since then, the country has made several additional requests for vaccines from the emergency stockpile and by 18 May had received 11.7 million doses in total. Ongoing vaccination campaigns due to the further spread of the disease are putting continuous demands on the stockpile.  In addition, outbreaks in Uganda and the DRC have stretched the global supply with demands for more than 700,000 and 2.2 million doses respectively.  Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The \u2018yellow\u2019 in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.", "events": [], "date_published": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 11:22:13 EST"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65TqDqur0XqbxsO7", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Associated Press"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Bath Iron Works"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the General Accounting Office "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Navy "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Lexington Institute "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "this summer"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Saturday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "December "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "January"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "next year "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the following year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "this summer "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "this fall"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Maine "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Virginia"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Singapore"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Marinette"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Wisconsin"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mobile"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Alabama"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the South China Sea "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Russia "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Peter Fanta"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Fanta "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Michael Monsoor"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Zumwalt"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Fanta "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Fanta "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ensign Marc Rockwellpate"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Loren Thompson "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "David Sharp "}], "url": "http://www.philstar.com/world/2016/06/20/1594819/us-navy-warship-trade-some-speed-firepower-armor", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "US Navy warship to trade some speed for firepower, armor", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:28.227Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "MONEY", "value": "hundreds of millions "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "Two "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "50 "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "610-foot "}, {"code": "MONEY", "value": "$482 million to $563 million "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "Two "}, {"code": "PRODUCT", "value": "The USS Milwaukee "}, {"code": "QUANTITY", "value": "40 miles "}, {"code": "PRODUCT", "value": "the USS Fort Worth "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "zero "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "one "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "first "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "about two dozen "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "40 "}], "article": "AVWicg0HAi2xnyAOXn6h", "content": "BATH, Maine \u2014 The Navy spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to fulfill its need for speed with a new class of fast and agile warships capable of zipping along at highway speeds.  It turns out speed is overrated.  The Navy has learned lessons from the light-and-speedy littoral combat ships: Upcoming ships will trade some speed in favor of more weapons and heavier armor.  Rear Adm. Peter Fanta, director of surface warfare, said the goal is to increase the offensive punch of all warships from the biggest to the smallest. For the littoral combat ship, that'll begin with the installation of over-the-horizon missiles this summer.  \"Each ship that I now have \u2014 I have to make more lethal because I cannot build ships fast enough, or enough of them,\" Fanta told The Associated Press.  Two versions of the warships were sped into production to meet the Navy's goal of an affordable, fast ship to operate in shallow coastal \u2014 or littoral \u2014 waters.  The ships, which are capable of topping 50 mph, utilize steerable waterjets instead of propellers and rudders to operate in shallow water.  They also are built to be equipped with swappable mission modules for surface warfare, anti-submarine duty or mine removal. That's in contrast to larger, multi-mission ships like the 610-foot Michael Monsoor, a Zumwalt-class destroyer christened Saturday at Bath Iron Works.  But the gee-whiz factor was overshadowed by concerns over growing costs \u2014 the latest versions cost $482 million to $563 million apiece \u2014 along with criticism by the General Accounting Office that the warships were too lightly armed and too lightly armored.  Two high-profile breakdowns, in December and January, raised additional questions about reliability: The USS Milwaukee had to be towed 40 miles to a naval base in Virginia, while the USS Fort Worth was sidelined in Singapore.  Fanta said the Navy is learning from the initial deployments and incorporating changes into a new version which will be called a frigate. The Navy also intends to zero in on one design either next year or the following year, leading to cost savings.  The Freedom class with a steel monohull is built in Marinette, Wisconsin, while the tri-hulled, aluminum Independence class is built in Mobile, Alabama.  Both were rushed into production to deal with unconventional post-Cold War threats including swarm boats and pirates. But the threats have changed again with China flexing its muscle in the South China Sea and Russia reasserting its naval presence.  Despite growing pains, Fanta sees the warships as being made more capable through heavier armor plating and shock mounting to make them sturdier, along with additional weapons.  The first over-the-horizon missile capable of hitting targets more than 50 miles away is to be installed this summer and it will be followed by tests of a second missile variant this fall, he said. Some of the capabilities will be fitted onto existing ships, about two dozen of which are either in the fleet, under construction or under contract. Eventually, the Navy plans to build 40 of them.  The resulting ship will be slightly slower and heavier, but the weapons will make enemies keep their distance, he said.  It's unclear how much speed will be lost because of the added weight.  \"We acknowledge that there will be trade-offs in speed based on additional weight to support increased capabilities. That number will be defined further as the ship's design continues to mature,\" said Ensign Marc Rockwellpate, a Navy spokesman.  Loren Thompson from the Lexington Institute said it makes sense to place less emphasis on speed. \"You can't outrun a missile,\" he said.

Photo: AFP  Frankfurt: Embattled German auto giant Volkswagen (VW) will face the wrath of its shareholders at its annual meeting on Wednesday as it struggles to steer itself out of an unprecedented engine-rigging scandal.  Nine months after the \u2018Dieselgate\u2019 affair, when it emerged VW had installed emissions-cheating software into 11 million diesel engines worldwide, the former paragon of German industry is still nowhere near drawing a line under its deepest ever crisis. The costs of the affair are still incalculable and it is not yet known whether VW\u2019s own internal investigation will pinpoint the major culprits behind the scam. But small shareholders are likely to use the upcoming annual general meeting (AGM) in the northern city of Hanover to let off steam at the way management has handled the affair, even if the power those shareholders wield remains limited.  They hold just 11% of the voting rights in VW, while the founding families Porsche and Piech hold 52%, the regional state of Lower Saxony 20% and the Emirate of Qatar 17%.  Ulrich Hocker, head of the DSW association of small shareholders, told AFP he has been attending the company\u2019s AGMs for the past 20 years and he expects this one to be \u201cvery different, very contentious.\u201d  \u201cThere will be very little discussion about the group\u2019s operating performance. It will focus almost solely on the diesel engine scandal and claims for compensation,\u201d he predicted.  The Volkswagen group, which owns 12 brands ranging from Volkswagen and Porsche to Audi and SEAT, is facing regulatory fines, as well as a myriad of lawsuits from shareholders and car owners.  Shareholders accuse management in particular of dragging their feet in informing them about the scam, which led to a reeling 40% drop in the company\u2019s share price last autumn.  The stock has since recovered somewhat, but is still 26% below the levels before the scandal broke last September.  Shareholder meetings in Germany tend to be long and drawn out as mom-and-pop investors stand up to have their say, but this one could stretch late into the evening.  A number of shareholder lobby groups, such as DSW and SdK, are demanding special enquiries into who should be held responsible for the affair, arguing that an investigation being carried out by US consultants Jones Day is not sufficiently independent.  Shareholders can also voice their discontent by withholding their formal \u2018approval\u2019 of management actions over the course of the past year, normally only a formality at German AGMs. But any such vote in the case will remain symbolic as VW\u2019s biggest shareholders are likely to give their support to the management.  The issue of the management board\u2019s pay is also likely to rile many, since the shareholders are seeing their annual dividend slashed to just \u20ac0.17 per share from \u20ac4.86 a year earlier, while board members are likely to still pocket generous bonuses.  The dividend proposal \u201cwill come under heavy fire,\u201d said Metzler bank analyst Juergen Pieper, while DSW\u2019s Ulrich Hocker slammed it as \u201cridiculous\u201d.  VW was compelled to set aside \u20ac16 billion in provisions to cover the costs of the affair so far, pushing it into a net loss of \u20ac1.6 billion, the carmaker\u2019s first loss in 20 years.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 11:24:12 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65j9Dqur0XqbxsPQ", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Nuclear Suppliers Group "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NSG "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "SCO"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NPT"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "NSG"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "Jun 19"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 16-17 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Sunday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 24"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 16-17 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "May "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "June 23 "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "New Delhi"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Beijing"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Seoul "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Beijing"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Tashkent"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Uzbekistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "China "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Pakistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "US"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Britain"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Italy"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Mexico "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Switzerland"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Shankar "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "S Jaiishankar "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Vikas Swarup "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jaishankar "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Pranab Mukherjee"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Jaishankar\u2019s "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Narendra Modi"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Xi Jinping "}], "url": "http://dailymessenger.com.pk/2016/06/20/india-bends-down-pleading-china-for-inclusion-in-nsg/", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "India bends down pleading China for inclusion in NSG", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:27.387Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Indian "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Indian "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Indian "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Indian "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Chinese "}, {"code": "ORDINAL", "value": "second "}, {"code": "PRODUCT", "value": "\u2019s NSG "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Chinese "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Chinese "}], "article": "AVWicgz7Ai2xnyAOXn6e", "content": "New Delhi, Jun 19: India has sunk to plead China for support for inclusion in Nuclear Suppliers Group with Foreign Secretary S J Shankar visited China covertly during which he assured China that India will not create any obstacle in the way of any other country.

As per a Geo News report, the team had recovered important documentary evidence pertaining to an ongoing corruption scandal in the Balochistan government.  According to NAB sources, the raiding team also found foreign currency and weapons of a prohibited caliber from Langov\u2019s residence. Another item of interest, which was not found in yesterday\u2019s operation, was the former finance adviser\u2019s bullet-proof vehicle that is estimated to be worth around Rs50 million.  The car, it was said, had been registered in the name of one of Langov\u2019s frontmen, Sohail Shah, who had earlier been arrested from Hyderabad.  The NAB sources said that one of Langov\u2019s brother \u2013 who is believed to have gone into hiding with the armoured vehicle \u2013 is wanted by the bureau and efforts were underway to trace and arrest him at the earliest.  Important revelations, according to the NAB sources, could be expected within the next 24 hours.  In May, Langov had said he was stepping down from his post to aid transparent investigations after a huge amount of ill-gotten money was recovered from the residence of the provincial finance secretary, Mushtaq Raisani.  In the raid on Raisani\u2019s house on May 6, NAB had recovered a huge amount in local and foreign currency stashed away on the premises.  According to an initial count, around Rs730 million worth in currency and prize bonds were recovered from the then serving bureaucrat's residence.  Having announced his decision to step down, Langov had resigned from his post following Raisani\u2019s arrest. At the time, Langov stated that he was resigning because a person from his department was being accused of serious corruption and foul play, hence he was not morally eligible to stay in his post.  The then adviser to CM on finance had, however, clarified that there was no inquiry initiated against him nor had there been any allegations levelled against him.  On May 25, though, NAB officials had taken him into custody shifted him to the NAB headquarters.  NAB officials arrested Langov from outside the Balochistan High Court, where he had appeared for the hearing of a pre-arrest bail plea in relation to the investigation in Balochistan secretary finance Mushtaq Raisani\u2019s corruption scandal.  He was arrested as he was exiting the court premises after the BHC bench dismissed his plea, even though the Islamabad High Court had, on May 17, granted him protective bail of 12 days.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65nHDqur0XqbxsPU", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the United Nations Educational"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The provincial Education Department "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UPI "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNICEF "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Situation Analysis of Children "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Education for All "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNESCO "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the U.N.

The country has a national literacy rate of 70 percent for males and 47 percent for females, the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey 2011-2012\u00a0shows. In Sindh's urban areas, the male literacy rate is 85 percent and female literacy rate is 70 percent, but in rural Sindh the figures are 58 percent for males and 23 percent for females, whose opportunity to pursue an education is often hindered by the religious and cultural tradition known as purdah, which limits their ability to move outside their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.  The six-month program, expected to start this year, will be aimed at girls and women ages 15 to 25 in rural areas, the senior program manager for the digital literacy project, Ghulam Nabi Leghari, said.  It will focus initially on women who have never attended school. A female coordinator will visit selected candidates' homes to give weekly classes and regular lessons will be sent to them by cellular phone.  \"Initially the program will be sending text messages to the female students. If they and their families agree to send them, then classroom teaching will begin,\" Leghari told UPI Next.  The classroom phase would involve three hours of work a day, six days a week for two months. In the third month, students would receive cellphones and would be able to send and receive Sindhi-language text messages, using software developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and a local telecommunications company.  \"Learners will be selected on the basis of whether they are semiliterate. This criteria may be relaxed in \u2026 some special cases. Around 750 cellphone sets will be provided to learners, 30 for teachers, 10 for coordinators and 10 for monitoring purposes,\" Leghari said.  He said students in the program would be able to send text messages free for four months and that an organization would be hired to translate messages in Urdu -- Pakistan's national language and the language of the original training materials -- into Sindhi, and handle other functions related to the project, including training teachers.  Shaista Sattar, a 25-year-old woman who has never attended school, said the program could have a positive impact on the lives of rural Pakistani girls and women:  \"It is very important that girls will be trained to use the cellular phones and how to write and send text messages,\" Sattar told UPI Next.  \"Besides,\" she said, \"women and girls will also be able to receive education through cellphones. They'll be able to take their lessons whenever they have free time.\"  Provincial Senior Minister for Education and Literacy Nisar Ahmed Khuhro told UPI Next that female literacy is important in any country's development, and in regions where female literacy is low, speedy programs need to be implemented.  The provincial Education Department is planning to start mobile-based literacy programs in three districts -- Jacobabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Thatta -- where female literacy rates are the lowest. Each district will have 10 centers, where the educational content of the text messages will be prepared and sent to students.  \"The main purpose is to open 30 centers for female adult literacy to help female learners improve their acquired basic literacy skills through mobile phones, and apply these skills for their own betterment as well as the betterment of other females of the area, and improve the overall living standard of the village or community,\" the minister said.  Interactive sessions using computers and the Internet will be used in addition to mobile phones, he added.  Provincial Education Secretary Fazlullah Pechuho said the project would help girls in remote areas who have less access to primary schools.  \"If the project is successful then the circle of the program will be extended to other districts to ensure provision of basic education to females,\" Pechuho told UPI Next.  UNICEF pointed to low levels of public spending on education in its 2012 report, Situation Analysis of Children and Women in Pakistan.  Although Pakistan has signed up for the Education for All global initiative begun in 1990 by UNESCO to meet all adult education needs by 2015, and the U.N. Millennium Development Goals -- which include providing universal primary education by 2015 -- \"consistently low levels of public expenditures on education and on social services in general, suggest that the level of political commitment is, in practice, rather weak,\" the report said.  \"The EFA Global Monitoring Reports ... have highlighted that Pakistan is off track for achieving universal primary education by 2015, and accounts for a substantial share of the global number of children out of school,\" the report found.  Moreover, UNESCO has said, the 7.3 million children out of school in Pakistan in 2009 represented 34 percent of the country's primary school-age population.  A 2012 report by the provincial government found Sindh's literacy rate had stalled for the previous three to four years at 59 percent, with female literacy at 22 percent and more than half of school-age children not attending school.  \"Currently, the biggest challenge for Sindh is out-of-school children. More than 50 percent of children are out of school. Keeping in view these challenges, Sindh has to come up with out-of-box solutions to improve the literacy rate of the province,\" the report, issued by the provincial government's education management information program known as SEMIS, states.  Sindh has 47,557 schools, of which 42,328 are functional and 5,229 are closed, including 3,995 temporarily closed and 1,234 permanently closed, SEMIS data shows.  The availability of teachers was described as \"worrisome.\" Nearly 20,000 schools have one teacher only, resulting in schools having to teach multiple grades together, while 9,103 schools have two teachers.", "events": [], "date_published": "Sat, 29 Mar 2014 12:16:07 -0400"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65q8Dqur0XqbxsPZ", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the United Nations "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Ministry of Interior"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Islamic State "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the SITE Institute"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The Islamic State "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Nepalese "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Canadian Embassy"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Taliban "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "early Monday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Monday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the holy month "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "early June"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "last the month"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Monday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "many years"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Monday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the last year"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "months"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Monday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "September 2014"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "64"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "KABUL"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Afghanistan "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kabul "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kabul "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Afghanistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kabul "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Afghanistan"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Nepal "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "India"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kabul"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kabul"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kabul"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Badakhshan "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sediq Sediqqi"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Zabihullah Mujahid"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Deborah A.

The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the bombing, along with another explosion in the city on Monday morning that wounded a Kabul provincial council member. The twin explosions shattered a relative calm in Kabul during the holy month of Ramadan, which began in early June, and underscored the Taliban\u2019s rejection of a request by the United Nations for a cease-fire that would last the month.  Thousands of Nepalese security contractors, in particular, work at foreign military or diplomatic compounds in Afghanistan, many drawn to work here by better wages and more jobs than are available for them back home. Despite tight security measures at the foreign missions where they work, or surrounding their barracks, the contractors often travel to work in unguarded buses that are seen as especially vulnerable to insurgent attacks.  The minibus carrying the contractors was traveling through the eastern part of Kabul when it was attacked by a bomber wearing an explosive belt and traveling on foot, security officials said. Sediq Sediqqi, the spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, put the death toll at 14, with eight more people wounded, some of whom might also have been civilians.  Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, made the claims of responsibility on Twitter and gave a higher death toll for the bus bombing, saying that 20 foreign guards had been killed.  Later on Monday, a branch of the Islamic State also claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to the SITE Institute, which tracks jihadist groups. It was impossible to reconcile the competing claims. The Islamic State statement mistakenly asserted that the Nepalese contractors worked at the American Embassy rather than the Canadian Embassy.  Canada\u2019s ambassador to Afghanistan, Deborah A. Lyons, said in a statement that 12 of the victims were from Nepal and two were from India. \u201cMany of the men killed today have been part of our embassy family for many years,\u201d she said.  In the second bombing in Kabul, Attaullah Faizani, a member of Kabul\u2019s provincial council, was wounded along with two other people when an explosive device detonated about 40 yards from the council member\u2019s home, according to Fraidoon Obaidy, a senior police official in Kabul.  In a separate bombing, 10 people, including some children, were killed in the northeastern province of Badakhshan when an explosive-laden motorcycle detonated in a traffic roundabout, local officials said. The Taliban officially denied that they were behind that bombing, as they have with some other attacks in which most of the victims were civilians. But later, Taliban commanders in the province told a reporter that the group was, in fact, responsible the bombing.  The surge of violence on Monday highlighted the challenges facing the government as a resurgent Taliban that has expanded its territory over the last year. But as the threats have escalated, the post of defense minister has been left vacant for months, fueling a perception that the Afghan government had yielded its authority over the war effort to American commanders.  On Monday, the Afghan parliament approved a nominee, Gen. Abdullah Khan Habibi, as defense minister, after numerous previous attempts to fill the post had failed since the government was first installed in September 2014. General Habibi, 64, had served in the armed forces or defense ministry under several previous Afghan administrations \u2013 including under Taliban rule, military officials said.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 16:18:47 GMT"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65w8Dqur0XqbxsPf", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "FIR "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "News "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mamata "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "IPC Sections"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "June 19"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "yesterday "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "a day "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Friday "}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Calcutta"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Sovan Chatterjee's "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Ratna Chatterjee "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mamata Banerjee "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Rajeev Kumar "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Mamata "}], "url": "http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160620/jsp/bengal/story_92208.jsp", "date_collected_as_date_published": true, "title": "Sovan wife files Narada FIR", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:21.897Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "four "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "171 "}], "article": "AVWicgxHAi2xnyAOXn6F", "content": "Calcutta, June 19: Mayor Sovan Chatterjee's wife yesterday lodged an FIR accusing Narada News of trying to \"affect the election result\".

The complainant Ravinder Singh Bassi, in his complaint to the court, has also made Sector 34 SHO and SSP Chandigarh as co-accused.   The court has fixed July 1 for hearing and has asked the complainant, an advocate, to produce primary witnesses in the court.   Earlier, on June 15, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) in a letter written to Chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification Pahlaj Nihalani had asked him to get the controversial song removed from the film as it was desecration of the Sikh symbol.   \u201cThe song depicts a semi-clad Jacqueline Fernandez, dancing with a kirpan dangling in front of her legs and supported by a cloth belt worn around the waist by her and thereby made the mockery of the sacredness and respect of the religious symbols of kirpan,\u201d Manjinder Singh Sirsa, general secretary, DSGMC, said.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 17:52:40 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65zBDqur0XqbxsPh", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "CBS"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Justice Department "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "House "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CNN"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Senate Homeland Security Committee"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Mateen "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Facebook "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Islamic State "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "CIA.

That profiling ban applies not only to federal agents but also to local law enforcement officers who participate in federal task forces.  Trump's increasing embrace of policies that could isolate Muslims in America is extraordinary for a candidate assured of his party's presidential nomination. The proposals have been roundly dismissed and criticized by many Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Civil libertarians, Muslims and others also have strongly disagreed, arguing that profiling is unconstitutional and often constitutes unlawful discrimination based on race, religion and other factors.  Law enforcement should remain allied with groups that might have helpful information, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in an interview that aired Sunday.  \"It is very important for to us maintain our contacts within the Muslim community, because, often, individuals, if they're from that community and they're being radicalized, their friends and family members will see it first. They will see activity first. And we want that information to come to us,\" Lynch said on CNN's \"State of Union.\"  Trump's statements are consistent with his other, long-expressed views on how to stop terrorism in the United States, including a temporary ban on foreign Muslims from entering the country until the U.S. can figure out \"what is going on.\" But he's intensified his approach since Omar Mateen carried out the worst mass shooting in modern American history on June 12 at a gay club in Orlando, Florida. Forty-nine people were killed in the attack, which stoked a mix of fears about terrorism, guns and violence against gays.  Mateen's motive isn't clear, but a letter from the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said Mateen wrote on Facebook that \"real Muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the West.\" He also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, his ex-wife said he was mentally ill and his father suggested that gays had angered him.  Trump's response to the tragedy was, in part, a pointed confrontation with Muslims, whom he singled out for knowing where terrorists are and not turning them into authorities. In the same speech, he also expanded his ban on Muslim immigration to include people from regions with a history of terrorism.  On Sunday, Trump also said the government should investigate mosques in the U.S. in much the same way the New York Police Department's Demographics Unit spied on Muslims and mosques around the city with help from the CIA. The group assembled databases on where Muslims lived, shopped, worked and prayed, infiltrated Muslim student groups, put informants in mosques and monitored sermons, The Associated Press reported in 2011.  Under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the NYPD announced it had abandoned the program following lawsuits and complaints.  \"You do (it) as they used to do in New York prior to this mayor dismantling\" the program, Trump said Sunday.  Americans are strikingly divided over whether to single out Muslim communities as part of a plan to fight terrorism, according to an AP-GfK poll conducted March 31 through April 4.  Forty-nine percent of respondents said they favor surveillance programs aimed at predominantly Muslim communities in the United States to obtain information about possible radicalization. Forty-seven percent of those surveyed opposed the practice.

A Reuters witness saw several apparently dead victims and at least two wounded being carried out of the remains of a yellow bus after the suicide bomber struck the vehicle in the capital.   Hours later, a bomb planted in a motorbike killed at least eight civilians and wounded another 18 in a crowded market in the northern province of Badakhshan, said provincial government spokesman Naveed Frotan. The casualty count could rise, he said.   The attacks are the latest in a surge of violence that highlights the challenges faced by the government in Kabul and its Western backers as Washington considers whether to delay plans to cut the number of its troops in Afghanistan.   Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said on Twitter that 14 people had been killed and eight wounded in the attack in Kabul. Police were working to identify the victims, he said.   The casualties appeared to include Afghan civilians and Nepali security contractors, Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi said, after police and emergency vehicles surrounded the scene in the Banae district in the east of the city.   He said the suicide bomber had waited near a compound housing the security contractors and struck as the vehicle moved through early morning traffic. Besides the bus passengers, several people in an adjacent market were also wounded in the attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.   The Taliban claimed responsibility for the Kabul attack in a statement from the Islamist group\u2019s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, on Twitter. However it denied responsibility for the attack in Badakhshan.   Islamic State, which is bitterly opposed by the Taliban, said it carried out the Kabul attack but Zabihullah Mujahid dismissed the claim as \u201crubbish\u201d.", "events": [], "date_published": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 17:48:56 +0000"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH65-NDqur0XqbxsPt", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "The United Nations "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "LRA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the UN Regional Office For Central Africa "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNOCA"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Security Council"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNOCA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "LRA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "LRA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UN "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "LRA "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Multi"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "MNJTF "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "UNOCA\u2019s "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "the Economic Community of Central African States "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ECCAS"}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "15 June 2016 "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "today"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the past six month"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "April "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "March "}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "14 May"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Uganda"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "the Central African Republic"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Democratic Republic of the "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Congo "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "LRA"}, {"code": "LOC", "value": "Boko Haram "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Boko Haram "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Abuja "}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Abdoulaye Bathily"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Bathily "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Bathily "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Boko Haram "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Boko Haram"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Boko Haram"}], "url": "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54238", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "At Security Council, UN envoy warns LRA shifting focus to more high-profile targets in Central Africa", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:32.748Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "NORP", "value": "Ugandan "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "two "}], "article": "AVWicg2OAi2xnyAOXn6z", "content": "15 June 2016 \u0096 The United Nations is concerned about the impact of Uganda\u2019s potential withdrawal from military operations against the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) in the Central African Republic, the Secretary-General\u2019s envoy for the region said today, stressing that a departure of Ugandan troops must be well-coordinated.  \u201cThe LRA continues to threaten the security of the population in its operating area and has notably increased its alleged attacks in the Central African Republic (CAR) during the reporting period, reportedly extending into areas that had previously seen little to no LRA movement,\u201d said Abdoulaye Bathily, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative and head of the UN Regional Office For Central Africa (UNOCA), in his briefing to the Security Council.  Group elements have also persisted in attacking the civilian population in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), he added.  UNOCA has continued its active engagement to fill coordination gaps on the LRA issue over the past six month, convening the bi-annual meeting of LRA focal points in April and also, together with the AU and other UN partners, organizing a workshop in March to identify more clearly the respective roles and responsibilities of different actors in LRA-affected countries that are assisting LRA members who have defected or escaped from the group, Mr. Bathily said.  Although the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in CAR has put the country back on the path of sustainable peace, development and longer-term peacebuilding, challenges remain immense, in the context of ongoing, serious protection and humanitarian needs, crushing poverty and urgent requirements in the areas of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation as well as on security sector reform, he noted.  \u201cArmed groups still control large parts of the country, and the Government is in need of the full political, programmatic and financial support of the international community to ensure the re-establishment of state authority throughout the country,\u201d Mr. Bathily explained.  On Boko Haram insurgents, he said that the collective efforts of the Lake Chad Basin countries have reduced the terrorist group\u2019s capacity to undertake frequent attacks, as the cross-border operations by the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have captured Boko Haram fighters, freed captives and reclaimed territory from the group.  Boko Haram, however, continues to pose a serious threat to regional stability, he said. While humanitarian assistance has been mobilized for the populations affected by Boko Haram, the number of internally displaced persons and refugees fleeing from Boko Haram violence continues to rise, with limited funding received thus far to address the growing humanitarian needs.  \u201cFor these reasons, it is crucial that international partners maintain their support to the region to end the threat posed by the group and stress the need for a holistic regional approach, as emphasized during the Second Regional Security Summit, held in Abuja on 14 May,\u201d he said, urging the global community to support MNJTF through the mobilization of requisite political, logistical and financial support in a flexible manner.  In all of UNOCA\u2019s work, he noted, principal partner remains the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), and during the reporting period, the two institutions have focused on the further strengthening of their relationship.", "events": [{"code": "EVENT", "value": "the Second Regional Security Summit"}], "date_published": "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 15:21:41 EST"}, "_index": "events"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "event", "_id": "AVXH66BSDqur0XqbxsPz", "_source": {"organizations": [{"code": "ORG", "value": "VIENNA"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "OPEC"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "OPEC Secretariat "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "The OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "ORB"}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Saharan Blend "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Basra Light "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Kuwait Export "}, {"code": "ORG", "value": "Bonny Light "}], "dates": [{"code": "DATE", "value": "20th June"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "Friday"}, {"code": "DATE", "value": "the previous day"}], "language": "english", "places": [{"code": "GPE", "value": "Algeria"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Angola"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Ecuador"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Minas "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Indonesia"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Iran "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Iran"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Iraq"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Kuwait"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Libya"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Nigeria"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Qatar "}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Qatar"}, {"code": "GPE", "value": "Saudi Arabia"}], "people": [{"name": "john"}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Murban "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Girassol "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Oriente "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Es Sider "}, {"code": "PERSON", "value": "Merey "}], "url": "http://www.menafn.com/1094819850/OPEC-daily-basket-price-for-Friday-announced?src=RSS", "date_collected_as_date_published": false, "title": "OPEC daily basket price for Friday announced", "date_collected": "2016-06-20T18:02:40.545Z", "times": [], "languages": [], "source": "phoenix", "other": [{"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "thirteen "}, {"code": "CARDINAL", "value": "44.03 "}, {"code": "NORP", "value": "Arab "}], "article": "AVWicg53Ai2xnyAOXn7W", "content": "VIENNA, 20th June, 2016 (WAM) -- The price of OPEC''s basket of thirteen crudes stood at US44.18 a barrel on Friday, compared with 44.03 the previous day, according to OPEC Secretariat calculations.
